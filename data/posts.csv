Exemple : ""What a strange, wonderuful world"" =""Quel monde estrange et merveilleux"". Estrange being an old form of etrange, wich is french for strange. A lot of her voicelines use either old froms of existing words, or really old sentence structure.

iexnu,Papaya_Dreaming,"In a total shakeup for League of Legends, Riot Games has decided that the next step forward for Rek'sai's lore is to transform her into a human. In *The Miracle within the Void,*  many truths are revealed, but the most shocking twists comes with gameplay implications: Rek'sai will no longer take on her monstrous form. See below:

> Rek'sai looked in the mirror. She was about six feet tall, with long legs and eyes of stunning violet amethyst. Her hair flowed like a broke down to her voluptuous $19.99 shoulders, her bosom rising and following as she took in the surrounding air and rebreathed it into a soft, cherry minty scent.

This VGU will see the retirement of the old Rek'sai kit: skittering about, digging, screaming guttural cries. Riot justified their decision by claiming: ""well it was just a bit uncouth, you know?"" 

Instead, Rek'sai will attack with purple frilly energy and have ten dashes. 

Stay tuned for more major updates--for instance, Shaco will be receiving an update that turns him into a chiseled acrobat a la The Robin from Batman. Reasoning includes ""well i don't fucking know, he's got an edgy past and does stunts that'd give him muscle definition.""",2021-03-27 20:47:34,11676.0,med4p1

I know there's a reason why she's blue, but I also wondered how she'd look like if she had the green color scheme like the other Shadow Isles champion under Viego. 

So I did a simple color change to see how it'd look like!

The two picture that are edited have different saturations of the green hue. 

Edit: Sorry if the picture is in low quality, the splash hasn't been oficially revealed yet so I'm not able to find a higher quality pic.

157d13,Arneeman,"The year is 2026. You are watching the League of Legends world finals.

On the red side, we have T (formerly known as T1). They have benched Faker for now, preparing their rookie for the upcoming Tyler1 Championship, the biggest event of the year. 

On the blue side, we have Unicorns of Love. They have risen to power lately in the competitive scene after obtaining the legendary coach duo Dopa and Apdo. 

In the draft phase, you watch as UoL uses three of their counterbans to enable their midlaner, Chinese Quiyana. This has been a very successful strategy for them so far. However, this allows T to get powerful picks such as Dr. Mundo, who has been a contested pick after his rework that added 5 dashes and an anime protagonist look to his kit. 

In the early game, UoL gets a big advantage toplane when their Sylego steals Mundo's gold, punishing him for a risky recall. This helps them win the Taco Bell Scuttle Teamfight. 

However, T has the Starbucks Scaling on their side. Their rookie is playing Azir, who is very powerful with the newly discovered AD build that lets him deal a lot more damage after the nerfs. Even though the early game is rough, they manage to stack Dunkin' Dragons and eventually gets a gold lead with a Red Bull Baron Powerplay.

It's all down to the final dragon fight - each team has 3 dragons at this point. Chinese Quiyana fails to assassinate Azir, and Sylego stealing Mundo's health bar isn't enough to win UoL the fight. T claims the Bad Dragon Soul and gets a Bud Light Ace.

As they are about to finish the game, Sylego respawns. In the last second, he times it perfectly and steals the nexus kill. The crowd explodes as UoL manage to clutch out a win.",2021-03-28 20:41:28,23.0,mf0qae

pi2w5,olofmeyser,"Sometimes when I want to try out a champion I want to play something that is more about fighting like Nexus Blitz, where I don't have to sit through a laning phase first and can get right into the action. ARAM is great for this, but obviously not being able to pick my champion is the major issue for me there. Not having a random champion also helps motivating me (for the lack of a better term) to jump into the game, because I generally know what I will get as opposed to a frustrating ARAM roll.


Gamemodes like Nexus Blitz and Dominion were great for this kind of gameplay and I just wish we had such a gamemode to play consistently around the year and not just for a month in the year, as those times where they are available are the most interesting to play league for me.",2021-03-27 18:33:35,2087.0,meb8xk
igiew,moodRubicund,"Everyone is discussing Gwen's ability to dodge everything in a space around her, which she ""cuts out"" like a dress, but they're all confused about it when in fact it is absurdly simple. See, Gwen's ability allows her to ""cut out time"".  ""During"" this period of cut-out time, only Gwen remains fully conscious and is the only one who can re-adjust her actions. Other people will be unable to experience anything that happens  and will continue to act as they would have. After the effect of the  ability ends, all people other than Gwen will retain no memories of  anything that happened during the cut-out period.

 Simply put, Gwen's ability removes the cause but the effect remains. So you see, it ""just works"".

acxxb,lane182,"I have watched countless hours both LEC and LCS this season on [lolesports.com](https://lolesports.com), logged in and ready for drops while I watch the games. I pretty much keep my computer on all day Fri, Sat, and Sun as the games play in the background of what I'm doing. I would guess that I've only missed about 10% of all the games played, and yet there have only been 5 drops *total* all season long, all of which came from LEC games. I realize there is a possibility that I've been super unlucky and just happen to miss the games where they come out, but also, that is a pathetic amount of drops. Not one from LCS all season long? Really? Either get rid of the drop system so there's no BS between you and your viewers, or actually reward the viewers like you promised you would. Honestly, I wouldn't even care if the rewards were semi-garbage. Does giving out a random 150 BE once a week to viewers really matter that much that Rito has to be stingy about it?",2021-03-28 05:16:07,258.0,memw1j
8lbon35s,Kevon209209,"A lot of people play League of Legends as the game grows every single day. As a long time player, I used to play league 4-10 hours every day since 2013 and was extremely addicted to matches on the rift. When I started playing league in 2013, it felt like I was getting a rush from my games whenever I won and from the games I lost I would become better and learn from my mistakes.   


A year in I started playing ranked, which led to me slowly becoming toxic. It started to affect my relationships with friends and school as I would avoid friends and assignments to get another match of league in as soon I was done with school. I threw away my grades to just spend more time on League of Legends, I flaked from meetups with friends. I didn't think too much about it as I desired to become one of the top league players. Unfortunately reality only sets in if you're aware of your surroundings.  


Highschool came in and I continued to play league but now alone as my friends decided to stop playing league entirely as they found the game to be extremely repetitive. I continued to dig this hole where I continued to play League and didn't have any other hobby or interaction with the world. Everyday I continued the grind on ranked and was a hardstuck gold player. I graduated a year ago and I've really no memory that seems memorable with friends or family. I became an adult with little to no connections with the world. The hole I dug had become so deep that I felt like I couldn't get out.  


Fortunately, my family and middle-school friends helped me get away from League of Legends. They forgave me even after all I've done with avoiding them and ditching. I became less excited to open up league and gradually got away from the game over the past year.   


I wanted to tell my story as there may be others that are currently in this situation and don't realize it. League of Legends is a good game but playing a game too much diminishes the fun out of it and ends up feeling more like a chore. I still do play games but only towards the local-coop genre. If you know anyone that sounds like this please try to help them out as it's extremely addicting.",2021-03-28 07:23:13,129.0,mepbpw

As some of you may know, yesterday G2 and S04 played a Bo5 series, and for game 5 Abbedage, who was playing Azir, bought Luden's Tempest instead of Liandry's Anguish as a Mythic item, which raised some criticism in the post-game thread, and on Twitter. [Even the guy himself tweeted after the game.](https://twitter.com/S04Abbedagge/status/1375953454439497729)

With that said, I decided to run some numbers and see how much of a difference either Mythic would make at the later stages of the game, keeping the rest of his build but swapping the Mythic item. (**TL;DR at the end**)

I wanted to keep things more or less realistic, without getting too lost on details, so before anything else I checked (in between the item builds, levels, and the hovers and camera pans on the different players) the stats of each of G2's champions near the last teamfight of the game:

[HP and Magic Resist for each G2 champion \(may have minor differences to the actual game\)](https://preview.redd.it/5zb9e78pzqp61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=36968510e22230c60743faa6b653f62ed236eff5)

---

Afterward, I did the same thing for the Azir relevant stats, namely AP, Flat Magic Penetration, % Magic Penetration.

Build 1 (Actual Abbedage build) - **Luden's Tempest**, Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff, Zhonya's Hourglass, Sorc Shoes, Oblivion Orb

Build 2 - **Liandry's Torment**, Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff, Zhonya's Hourglass, Sorc Shoes, Oblivion Orb

[Azir's combat stats \(AP value assumes two AP runes\)](https://preview.redd.it/cw6epnwm0rp61.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=b11fea3a1b72a1bb82f823917c6d0a7850a8073e)

We can already see that, aside from some of the passives associated with the two Mythic Items, the Luden's build has a higher flat magic penetration than the other one.

With that said, I decided on two trades to compare the two builds:

A longer trade: **5 auto-attacks (with 3 sand soldiers), 2 Q's, 1E, 1R** \- For purposes of Liandry's burn I assumed the **trade went for 8 seconds**, which burns for a total of 12 seconds because it remains burning for 4 seconds after the trade ends). For purposes of Luden's, with the new reduction of the passive cooldown, I assumed that in those 8 seconds, the Luden's damage would proc 3 times. (**To summarize - 12 seconds of burn for Liandry's, and 3 Luden procs**)

A shorter trade: **2 auto-attacks (with 3 sand soldiers), 1Q, 1E, 1R** \- 4 seconds of trade duration (**8 secs of burn**) and **1 Luden's proc.**

---

Having both the trades and the combat stats for all champions involved, I calculated the modifiers to the magic damage, according to the Magic Resist (after Flat and % Magic Penetration) and the Bonus Health (which will later factor on for the Liandry's Torment's Agony passive)

&#x200B;

[Magic damage multiplier due to Magic Resist, for each Azir Build](https://preview.redd.it/v2acx1fu4rp61.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=465868e43a2d47b5e03eeea5ba9b01cb56a85091)

[Liandry's Torment Agony magic damage bonus \(\*I assumed that it increases in steps rather than linearly, according to the wiki. Not 100&#37; sure if that is correct\)](https://preview.redd.it/nio5weqf3rp61.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da545ea0609d14ad9753ebc71c1e43db044c8aa)

---

Since both builds have the same AP numbers, the raw damage from both trades will be the same. The difference makers will, therefore, be the difference in magic penetration between the two builds, and the difference in the passive applications (Luden Procs vs Liandry's Amplified Damage and Burn). The graph below shows the calculated damage (post magic reduction, considering the passives of both items - which means, the real damage the champions would take in that trade). It also shows the HP of each Champion:

[Damage dealt to each champion with both builds, for the long and short trade](https://preview.redd.it/1rww5ewq6rp61.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ed91387d5fcf8658636aad98c0d784c35c69435)

Some takeaways from the graph:

* The results show that the only champion against which building Liandry's is more powerful is Sion (and the difference is not insanely significant)
* Admittedly, the damage numbers of the long trade result in overkill for all the other 4 champions, so one can argue that you might as well buy Liandry's, since the combo will kill the other 4 champions anyways.
* For the shorter trade, both Gragas and Sion would survive. For Gragas in particular, both builds achieve nearly similar damage outputs.
* The favoring of Luden's has a few reasons:
   * Low magic resist numbers - with higher MR levels, especially on the champions with higher HP, the added flat magic reduction would be slightly less impactful.
   * Low HP values and Low Bonus HP values on Lucian and Seraphine - This impacts both the burn damage (Torment) and the amplification of magic damage (Agony). Combine that with the low MR of those champions, and Luden's value is amplified.
* The main takeaway for me is that even though, for practical terms, you could argue that Liandry's would be better for dealing with Sion in longer teamfights, the difference is not that significant.

Things that weren't considered in this analysis but should be noted because they impact the teamfights:

* The Liandry's burn grants the application of Grievous Wounds for longer periods of time.
* The Liandry's build has 55 ability haste, compared to 40 from the Luden's one (considering Transcendence rune at lvl 18) - in a 8-second trade you could *maybe* squeeze in an additional Q with the Liandry's build (so, 3 Q's as the CD becomes 3,9 secs) but the relationship of the graph would remain the same (only favored for Sion).
* Luden's gives bonus MS when proccing the passive.
* Luden's procs hit 3 additional champions (so added damage that wasn't considered here).

**TL;DR: It isn't that clear-cut that if Abbedage built Liandry's instead of Luden's the results would be significantly different.** 

\---

Bonus: 

For the long trade (8 seconds with 2Q's, 5AA, 1E, 1R - 12 sec burn or 3 Luden procs) I created a chart that lets you know which item would be more useful in the build, according to the enemy's HP and MR. For the purposes of calculating the bonus HP (for the Agony passive), I had to assume an arbitrary number for the base HP, which I set as 1900. The area with two colors is the range in which the damage between the two builds with the full combo varies between -50 and +50 for either side.

b4i689a9,Vladek779,"Hi, guys. I know there has already been a lot of discussion about how good Rell and Kalista's ult synergize with each other but here I would like to propose an idea that is all about the ""visual"" aspect of the duo. First of all, we all know that Kalista's black spear and and Rell's E creates a tether between them. Now lets add the rune Guardian into the equation. The rune also creates a nice visual effects when the two are close enough. Lastly, we get Knights Vow and Zeke's convergence, the only 2 items that create visual effects between 2 champions. In the end there should be 5 tether between the two champs.

1xmfmelb,daswef2,"Reminds me of 2014 where you could sit down before draft even started and list out the 20 champs that would appear.   Grand majority of the games just have the same handful of picks to the point where I regularly find myself closing the stream recently after pick/ban and going and doing something else.  We've seen hundreds of games of Gnar/Camille/Renekton, Udyr/Hecarim/Lillia, Ori/Azir/Viktor, Rell/Alistar/Thresh, it feels like it doesn't matter if you watch most of the matches since most of them play out the same way.  

It makes it really difficult to cheer for the grand majority of teams, and it feels like it really compounds the bandwagon problem.  If every team plays the same exact champions and the same compositions, why would we cheer for teams that are middle of the pack or below?  So few teams actually have unique picks and playstyles to differentiate themselves from the next team.  

I don't know how to fix this either.  It feels like we always find our way back to Ori/Azir at some point, so it must feel kinda pointless for pros to learn new strategies every patch to account for unique stuff that will inevitably get nerfed out and we'll just return to Ori/Azir or the equivalent for other lanes eventually.",2021-03-28 20:22:08,2.0,mf0gby
5etbqb5u,JacquesZhang,"We see the words ""Broken"" thrown around too losely in the league community. It's an important issue I want to address.

I think there's a pretty long history of League players calling just about every champion/item/whatever ""broken,"" and while that's fine and dandy, it takes away the meaning of the word. And that's problematic if we want to discuss issues intelligently and actually be able to identify legitimate problems and resolve them. 

When most people say ""Broken"" they generally mean that something is far too strong for whatever reason, and they take that as an excuse to why they lost. Seeing a 0/3/0 Darius suddenly flash-stridebreaker-pull you from a bush miles away feels ""Broken,"" especially if you're the poor 10/0/4 ADC getting killed. 

But that doesn't necessarily mean Stridebreaker or Darius as a champ is inherently overpowered or ""broken"". Pretty obviously, we can construct a thought experiment where we just continuously nerf the stats or cooldown of stridebreaker, until it becomes perfectly ""balanced"" with 50% winrate and Darius doesn't go 10/0/0 every game because the item is ""broken."" But those flash-stridebreaker-pull moments will still happen, and people will continue the scream ""broken!"" even though in theory the item is perfectly balanced. 

So what's going on here? Well, what the helpless 10/0/3 Jhin is really experiencing is not a ""broken"" item, it's a ""problematic"" interaction. It's not ""broken"" that a 0/3/0 darius solo-kills a fed jhin with 0 counterplay, even though it might seem like it is. You can always tweak the stats and whatnot so that even if niche cases like that occur, overall the item/champ combo doesn't get out of hand. 

It's **problematic**, since it doesn't respect the usual notions of getting fed, and it feels bad because it means doing well in lane and getting kills as the Jhin isn't being rewarded the way a game should be rewarding good play. It makes the game **unfun** and feels **unfair**. And that's why the solution isn't to nerf the stats until Darius/Stridebreaker is at a 47% winrate. That doesn't fix anything; the 10/0/3 Jhin will still get one-shot from miles away with no counterplay, and Bruiser accounts on twitter will continue to whine because of a 47% winrate item (which to be fair, is kinda justified. Neither side has any fun this way). The only real solution is to fix these **inherently problematic** interactions, which means removing problematic effects/interactions, not merely nerfing stats.

That's just my take on how balance should be approached to create a more satisfying game that respects fundamentals like ""oh hey getting kills should always matter, and oh hey when you're ahead you should defeat or at least come close to defeating someone who is behind"".  Disrespecting these unspoken assumptions is what causes people to have disdain for certain champs or feel that the game is highly unbalanced, when in reality balance (in terms of winrate or how strong the item feels/is) isn't the problem, but enjoyability is what's at stake.

I also want to mention that I have nothing to do with Darius/Jhin. I play mid and I'm also pretty bad so this discussion shouldn't be skewed much by personal bias. My argument applies just as easily to Darius vs Jhin as to any number of other interactions people call broken:

Ekko R, Goredrinker Healing, Galeforce Mobility, Syndra R, Vayne Top, Mundo going where he pleases, etc 

Think about each of these things and ask if they're actually ""broken"", or if they're just fundamentally problematic in their design and that is what makes them unfun. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully this opens more room for intellectual discussion that doesn't just start and end with ""Wow this thing is broken"" ""NoooOOoOo this thing is actually sooo bad if you just played it you would knowww."" Neither side is wrong in those discussions, which is why it's pointless to argue there. We need to address the actual problems and what makes things feel unfair or unfun.

432woqq1,condomtermite,"Hey,

I was trying to search information about Gwen's range type, but couldn't find anything. Does anyone here know if she is melee or ranged champion?

In her gameplay trailer, there is one moment where she is chasing Maokai, and swings her scissors from right to left on Maokai's back, which seems like it might be her basic attack. Here is a gif from that specific moment:

[Possibly her basic attack.](https://i.redd.it/d7qxi5kd4sp61.gif)

Do you think that's her basic attack or not?

If that is indeed her basic attack, it seems like she is a long-distance melee or short-distance ranged champion. One possibility is also that she is a hybrid champion, such as Gnar, Kayle or Poppy. That possibility cannot be ruled out.

If that's a short-distance ranged attack, it is probably on the same scale as Rakan's basic attack, which is **300**, but if that's a long-distance melee attack, it is probably on the same scale as Viego's basic attack, which is **225**. Still, it is hard to tell from this one sample.

\---

For anyone interested. Officially, melee attack's are considered to be between **125** to **250**, and ranged attack's from **300** to **650**, with Caitlyn currently being the record holder of the highest basic attack distance in the game.",2021-03-28 22:29:29,0.0,mf1sno
anwstemd,Ass_borger,"With the removal of Oracle elixir and the addition of these Oracle minions, it just removed any sort of counterplay to Shaco, while screwing Teemo up and any god that uses traps (Nidalee, Jhin).

These oracle minions do indeed reveal traps, but as for Shaco, they don't neutralize his boxes, meaning as a melee champion, even if you're able to spot them, you can't just kill them because their triggering area is larger than the range of melee auto-attacks, unlike Teemo's mushrooms or other traps. Adding the fact that his boxes have a really short cooldown (unlike Teemo, which is his ult), there's really not much you can do, even if the player is awful.

Worth mentionning that these Oracle minions don't reveal invisible champions either, meaning Shaco's Q has no counterplay, especially with him building max CDR.

And before some sweaty gold 4 Yasuo main comes and tells me ""iT'S oNlY ARaM WhO CaREs"", I *only* play ARAM, like many other players, and having champions that just remove the fun of the mode (currently : Akali, Seraphine and Shaco) makes me just not want to play anymore",2021-03-27 21:36:02,98.0,medx6k

For real, when I saw the first scene of the [piece teaser](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/%22%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8C%D0%BA%D1%96_%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B2%D0%B8_%D1%83_%D0%93%D1%80%D1%8E%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B9_%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%96_15_%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BD%D1%8F_1410_%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%22.jpg) I was excited to see a mounted soldier.

Then I saw the [other trailer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Chess_piece_-_White_knight.JPG) and all my interest instantly vanished. We already have way, WAY too many pieces that look like blocks of wood or plastic.

I know it's too late to change anything, but I would have liked to see something much closer to the badass soldier we saw in the trailer, like a happy, cute version of [MTG's Knight Exemplar](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/2/d/2d7da2c3-95d7-464f-af3d-fd891fd148f1.jpg?1562454633) as a piece.

edit: The king has a crown-like cross and a tall stature which is long, thin and more or less realistically proportioned. I'm talking specifically about a knight with armor and a sword, like the images I linked.

The king's look and animations are also explicitly royal-like. The closest thing we have to a fierce warrior is the queen.

There are things I like about the piece. Its movements are great, and forking the opponent's king and queen is cool af. Still disappointed though.",2021-03-27 16:46:52,163.0,me9zbe

The community is between love and hate at Gwen, half charges that she was more like a doll or with the palette of dark green colors(Just like the others on the shadow islands) and etc. I think it would be the right time for Riot to come back with this Skin theme (The old version of this theme The old version of this theme, just like orianna's skin).

5n5t2dd9,JerseyPumpkin,"My friend and I were talking about the new items and how we feel about them. I have been enjoying the new items while he has been hating them. 

**Why I like the new items:**

I like them because:

1. They bring the fun power spike to many champions quickly rather than having to wait to come online.

2. Some act as multiple items in one such as Turbo Chemtank being Righteous Glory and Sunfire Cape. 

3. You no longer have to buy your dull essential jungle item first, and then boots before finally getting to your fun items. You can now just get to your fun item first and no longer have to wait to get online.

4. They do succeed for most roles in creating a choice in what mythic you should go for.

&#x200B;

**Why my friend doesn't like the new items:**

My friend does not like the new items because he feels:

1. They are op.

2. They make the game more about whoever gets their mythic first wins lane.

3. The meta champions are the ones who abuse the items the most while other champions get kicked out of the meta because they can't use the items as efficiently.

   4. Does not like how they removed the number of active items and made items like Blade of the Ruined King's active become a passive now.

&#x200B;

Is a well known fact that in low elo people should play easy champions, the thing is as you progress does high skill cap champions start to take over? Does easy skill champions win rate in general start to go down considering manly people who main the champions? because obviously if they don't main the champion, low skill cap champions gonna be easier to perform on by nature. 

&#x200B;

So lets say a practical example, if a player likes late game adcs and want to choose 2 of them to main. This player chooses jinx and tristana because they are easier to learn. Does this player at any point in the ladder would find it beneficial to drop those 2 champions and pick kai'sa and vayne instead for the sack of being more effective champions to climb once you reach a certain elo?",2021-03-28 18:53:55,0.0,mez8gb
7jm1g02u,pwnies2012,"Since One for All is coming around on live servers, I decided to compile a list of all CC that every single champion has and how long they can CC you for, broken down into three sections.

Firstly, we have the uncleansible CC section, where we include knockups as that's the only form of CC that is uncleansible through things such as Gangplank W, QSS, etc. so that players can optimize the amount of time that you as a player are not allowed to play League of Legends.

Second, we got the cleansible CC. This includes almost all forms of hard CC that make your character unable to move, examples of roots, taunts, charms, stuns, and more so that you can optimize the amount of time your opponents are mostly not able to play League of Legends

Last, we got the soft CC section, which basically adds types of CC that don't completely cripple your ability to move. This includes slows, silences, disarms, grounds, etc. This allows you to see how much one champion makes you slightly less able to play League of Legends.

There might be slight errors with the exact duration of CC that a character can CC one character for, so if you spot anything feel free to message me so that I can fix it as soon as possible.

75tn2rtw,outoftries,"So what I thought was just thought has actually been (anecdotally) confirmed, you get honored based on your ingame performance more than your actual actions. Recently picked up league back a bit and since these are my first games in the season I'm not placed where I should and can fairly often to do well in-game, this has literally skyrocketed the number of honors I get, even if I'm annoyed at some choices people keep making and bluntly share it I've still gotten 4 honors in a single game. Not sure if it's just because I'm not annoying about it and people don't get defensive or if they just care that I carried.

&#x200B;

Either way, this is extremely sad to see considering what this means for smurfs, a demographic that most would consider one of the most problematic and toxic in the game. Effectively, if their playing well can keep their honor levels high, they won't be punished for toxic behavior while people who are in the rank they belong to (read: unable to carry every game, because that's realistic, none of us can if we're going against similarly skilled people) would.

&#x200B;

I don't like to discuss problems without offering solutions but here I don't really care, just felt like pointing out this problem.

&#x200B;

TL;DR You receive increased honors based on your performance, allowing smurfs who can continuously get good scores avoid punishment. I don't like this.

This has happened many times, and I gotta tell you, I don't even know what happens when you surrender for an early afk. idk how much LP you lose, etc, because people don't take the oppurtunity.

Someone explain, I'm furious because I had to lose a game at 18 minutes instead of 10:00 because TWO of the four non afk players said no. One of those players even pinged his 1300 ping which you'd think is unplayable. But he soldiered on, for some reason.

q122c7w,ElMaverickUK,"Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. 

So I'm still new to league really (long time hots player), picked it up in December, and so far on the whole It's been really cool and a fun experience. 

After butchering a few recommended heroes to begin the journey and playing around with champs I decided upon support as my main role and really tried to take the time to find out what I should be aiming for, how to play certain matchups etc. For reference I play mostly enchanters/mages (the engage/hook supports are next on my to learn list) and if it's ranked, it's almost always Nami so far. I'm currently silver IV after around 50 games, up from Bronze.. I want to say III where I was placed initially. Only Solo Q atm. 

So far, it's been going pretty well. I set myself some season long goals, geared towards wanting to be better and eventually climb to Gold and beyond, this first season is really a free hit for me and it's more about wanting to go against people at or preferably slightly above my skill level rather than wherever I wind up in this one.

Those goals are, 4 or less deaths per game, 75% kill participation, 3+ KDA with a 1.5-2x vision score in relation to time. Now these are very rough guides and on the whole I don't put too much importance on stats but I feel they are a good guide for someone new and they each address a fundamental part of the game.

less deaths means my positioning was probably not too shabby (however, very few deaths make me wonder how much more aggressive I should be), being with the team for kills means I'm at least part of it if not the main part, KDA.. I'm a support, assists is my Kill column 😂 but as far as a number by itself.. eh I'm at around 3.7 with Nami, so that's nice but its the least important of the 4 for me and vision score.. I find myself more interested in value I'm getting from vision rather than throwing wards down like it's going out of fashion, if a ward saves me or a teammate, or provides us good vision at the right time, that's the goal and money well spent. 

I think the above, whilst challenging to maintain for a new player are definitely achievable with some time and effort. 

Coming into this game fresh I was keen to avoid the problems people seem to have.

1. I'm no stranger to toxicity, I'm a moba player after all and let's face it Assholes are everywhere. I deal with them in one of 2 ways, I either kill them with kindness or the mute function. Sorry edgy bro, I'm trying to remember the 50 things I need to attempt to do without adding holding your hand to that list, however, I'm a very personable guy, will always bring positivity to my games, and a lot of games now which otherwise would be lost have been If not saved then at least edged back towards people trying with a 'don't worry folks, we can do this, what's done is done' and for those steamroller games where we are getting obliterated, what's the harm in trying an all in on baron or something? Best case we find an opening to get back, worst case we'll be back at home screen shortly. 

Thay being said, my mute function still gets a good workout 😂

2. Learning Curve.. 150+ champs, over a decade of experience to somehow try and sift through, Matchups for days all against mostly people who have been here a lot longer than I... I'm very late to the party and its a very daunting amount to try and deal with. I've tried to layer the information in a manageable way and speed for me whilst keeping the most important element, FUN. On the plus side there is a near limitless pool of experience and resource for me to draw from. 

With every champ I try out I will load up a guide page, have a look at rune combinations, really read the abilities/passives and get an idea for things like how I should be playing (am I poke/trade/all in etc) And generally throw on an intro to x champion video. This sets me up in the most basic of levels and helps me get my head in the space I need to.. speaking of which

3. Mentality. One life lesson that's taken me too many years to learn; You can only control the things you can control. Learn to make peace with that. I play poker also and will use an example. After investing a lot of time into learning how to play theory/odds etc, I have a pretty decent understanding of what I should be doing, I, on the whole put myself in situations where in theory I should win, I can raise the correct amounts, get myself all in against someone whose cards I know I'm beating because of how they have played before... And then 1 of the 2 cards that saves them rolls into town and takes a shotgun to my hundreds of hours of theory. 

What's the takeaway here? It's either **** that mother******, I'm the unluckiest person in the world and this only happens to me, or ""ok that sucks but I did everything right that I could have, and 90 times out of 100 I will win in that spot' I will keep putting myself in the most advantageous position I can by recognising my shortfalls and putting in the time to fill the gaps in my knowledge as best I can. 

I use this approach for gaming. Ask myself, what are the things I have control over; do I sit down looking forward to play? Am I sleeping/eating/drinking well atm? How do I feel? Also, I've implemented a 20 minute break system which triggers at either 2 hours or back to back losses. Giving your eyes and brain regular rests not only makes you feel better but gives you a neutral headspace to take a step back, get a little fresh air (tea and a smoke in the garden for me) and then come back to it feeling more optimistic. 

whilst we all want to be better.. we play games to (try to) have fun. There is enough poison in the world between the aforementioned assholes and thanks to the pandemic the rest of it seems to be on fire, it should be a release and escape from all that. All I can do is try my best, will it always be good enough? F*** No, but then that monstrosity of a learning curve  gave me some idea that was coming. 

------

Ok I've rambled enough now. A quick thank you to all of those who have taken the time, both knowingly and unknowingly to help a noobie out, on the whole this game has a lot of good people hidden away, but alas as with the rest of the world, those who shout loudest get heard most often, and for those having a hard time, it's all on you my friend, yes we all get bad teammates and yes we all do face-palm inducing moments of idiocy that make us want to crawl into the ground, but at the end of the day there is only 1 constant to every single game you will ever play, and that's you.

So take care of yourself, be modest and positive about approaching your weaknesses whilst reinforcing your strengths and I genuinely believe you can turn it around, I'll see you on the climb. GLHF all. Much love.",2021-03-28 17:27:07,0.0,mey66g

8iauwj69,myydaddybeatme,"I want to ask guys why healing is something riot can’t adjusted correctly ?

So much anti-healing in the game to the point you literally counter items and champions kit by 60% which is really not fair.

Take mythic items for example every mythic item in the game do more then one thing , however gore drinker which only heals that’s all this item does and yet it got massively nerfed it is literally the worst item in the game right now .

They really need to do something about healing and anti-healing reduce the effects from 60% to 30% and rebalance or remake the healing and champs who relays on healing.

Because here is a thing champions like aatrox when they get fed it is almost impossible to shut down because how much he can heal while also aatrox is completely useless once the enemy uses anti-healing on him.

so basically it is like I am god when I am fed but when the enemy get anti-heal I am nothing.

But how about I relay on healing and resistance to survive while also I can still have a decent healing when the enemy use grievous wounds on me .

This would actually really help the game in low and high elos cause the change would help the other champions to put down a fed drain champion while also being useful in the late stages of the game.

Anyway this is my opinion what do you think guys ?",2021-03-28 20:08:15,0.0,mf08n0

-Hello, please take a seat.

You sit on the chair as the man tells you.

-We shall begin our interview. It will be quick, so no need to worry. So, do you have any experience about programming or game design?

You look at the man with a confused face. “N-no, I dropped out of high school, I was hoping of janitorial staff or something, I mean I’m not suited for game design and such”

The man starts laughing

-Hahaha, I see you are a funny guy, you’ll blend in perfect with us.

You look at the man confused

-So you don’ have any game design experience, you see we are a game company. Have you played any video game?

“Uhh, I used to go out and play with my friends, but nothing much” you say, wondering what that has to do with being a janitor.

-Ahh, so you know just a little about gaming, and don’t have any experience about designing one. PERFECT! You are hired!

You are shocked. “W-what?”

-Ahh, don’t worry, we have 200+ years of collective game design experience, we can lend you some, cmon let’s visit the departments, I’m sure you can find one that suits you.

You don’t know what to do, but instinctively follow what the man told you. You two make your way to an office.

-This is the balance team, many new members had started here. Let’s take a peek and we’ll se if it suits you.

He opens the door and you walk in the room.

One of the employees welcome you.

-Oh hello rookie, welcome to the balance team. Come, sit, we were just starting to make the new patch.

You sit to one if the chairs as the meeting starts. One of the employees project the presentation

-Alright these are the champions with the highest winrates. You see those right rookie? We don’t touch those. Especially if they are in top lane. So let’s take those champions out of the list and move on. 

The man throws a bunch of small envelopes on the middle of the table, and asks you to pick one. You pick a random card. You pick one and open it. The card reads out as “Mordekaiser”

-Ah, great. We haven’t touched him in a while. You see that special coin? Flip it.

You grab the coin. One side is painted green with the word “buff”, and the other side is red with the word “nerf”.
“Is this really how you do this job, deciding everything random” you ask.

-Don’t worry rookie, that’s how we do business now, and it works so don’t worry.

You are confused, but still flip the coin. It lands on “buff”

-Alright roll those two dices in front of you know

You look at the table to see 2 strange dices. One is a 5 sided dice, with the letters “P,Q,W,E and R” on each side. The other is a 40-sided dice with a number printed on each side. You roll both. The first dice lands on “E”, and the other on “2”

-2 on E, hmm, so we shall reduce the cooldown on his E by 2 seconds, uhhhhh, on final rank.

You look at the riot employee that made the suggestion. You think that it feels stupid to make the game balance like this.

-PERFECT! I’m adding it to the notes now. You see, rookie? It’s that simple. Now, I’m nerfing Azir because why not? Adding those too. Now for the next character, pick another envelope

“I don’t understand, also what is that big red button there?” You ask, in curiosity and confusion.

-You’ll get used to it, don’t worry. Also, that button is the ultimate nerf, killing any champion it touches, only preserved for the most broken champions. The ultimate nerf, the one and fearful, “-5 movement speed!”

Everyone gasps with shock as they hear it, but you still look confused.

-You know what, why don’t you look at the other teams as well? Maybe you’ll find them better.

You look at your employer, and nod in agreement. You two now make your way to another room. 

-This is the Art and Design team

A breeze of warm air hits you as the man opens a steel vault door.

You peek inside, and what you see horrifies you. There is a teen on a throne, watching anime, throwing random characters into a machine which looks like a meat grinder while there are tens of men and woman chained from their necks, drawing and animating stuff on the screens in front of them. 

-That machine is our “champion mixer”, it creates new character from what gets thrown into it. That guy up there is the leader of the team, he “inspires” the artists for their work. He recently started watching anime, so it mixes with the designs, but whatever. And those people down there are the artists, making the visuals and music. It seems that taking the families of people hostage and chaining them makes them work wonderfully!

One man notices you, and looks into your eyes with his deformed face. “W-water, p-please” he says with a fading voice.

-Uhh, let’s move to the next department, shall we?

He drags you out of the “Design and Art” room as you slowly collect your mind.

-Let’s visit the writing team, maybe you’ll find them better

You two walk on a corridor and pass a glass office with chimpanzees in it. You stop and ask what that place is.

-Oh, that’s the “Bugs and Glitches” team, you see those chimpanzees are highly trained and are able to write code.

You look at them, amazed.

-But they usually make a mess, and that’s where Dave gets in.

He knocks on the glass, and a gorilla waves his hand to you.

-That’s Dave, he handles the things that those chimps break. We should consider giving him a rise some time. Alright let’s go one

As you walk, you can hear classical music getting louder and louder. You finally reach the source of it, a door, and as you open it, you see people on typewrites, smoking a cigar, drinking wine and writing something. They don’t even bother to welcome you, and keep writing.

-They are the writers, responsible for voice lines and lore. To be honest they really make good work. Did you knew that got this position by being a writer? Well, not really, but still. I was a member of the balance team, and after one day I saw my daughter playing with her dolls while watching a cartoon, so I decided to make a champion based on that, wrote my ideas and sent them to the higher ups. And they liked it, so I thought “Why don’t we make a character with the sole reason of making money” and it worked, so I got a raise and now I’m the manager of all departments here. And I’m proud of my work, did you read Seraphine’s story? That’s my biggest accomplishment!

You stop, and look at the man. 

Your mind stops

You find yourself inside a grand machine of misery and capitalism.

Close the door and walk towards the man.

You look at him in the eyes, raise your hand.



“I.......I w-will......”
.
.

.

You start breathing heavily

4hsfboi7,MooseMaster3000,"Namely, why it's not Aurelion Sol. First, we're not going to ignore the fact he has that crown on. Not having complete control of his actions is a handicap. On top of that, we're told he creates stars, but we're not told he does it *quickly*. We've no reason to believe he can do it any faster than stars form normally in our universe, as he never does so. 

Starting with him does however put us just a few steps away from the right answer. As we see:

1. In his story, Aurelion destroys the then-current incarnation of Pantheon. This kills the host body, but specifically *not* the god, as it's mentioned that Atreus was chosen immediately after that. 
2. However, we do know of someone who *did* kill the god. Aatrox, in his first and only fight with the actual ""Pantheon"", wins and kills the god itself, snuffing out the constellation but unwittingly giving Atreus-- the man-- control of his body once more. 
3. Atreus through sheer will reignites the constellation, essentially becoming not merely an incarnation of Pantheon, but the new god of war himself. 
4. He then defeats Aatrox, solidifying his spot at #1. 

In short: Sol can't kill gods, but Aatrox can. And Pantheon beat him, so that puts Pantheon above Sol.

nh2y3,Djinn_in_Tonic,"So, this is definitely a somewhat controversial topic, but I figured I'd give my thoughts on why I think Gwen's design is fantastic for what she is.

--------------------

#Why Isn't She Creepy?

Well, Gwen isn't really related to the Shadow Isles *directly*.

* Her teaser video shows her stuck in a drawer, not going to the Blessed Isles.
* She ended up underwater, but we don't know where or how. This isn't necessarily the Shadow Isles themselves.
* She was given life by part of Isolde's soul, which appears free from corruption.
* She is the **Hallowed Seamstress**, implying sanctification, purity, and holiness.

As such, it makes little sense for her to appear creepy, possessed, or monstrous. Since she was transformed by a pure magic (especially since her abilities and title suggest the magic of the Blessed Isles themselves), she should not be creepy or appear violent or antagonistic.

---------------------------

#Why Isn't She More Doll-Like?

Being a doll was Gwen's origin, but it doesn't appear to be her *story*. She is **The Hallowed Seamstress**, not **The Blessed Doll**. Unlike **Orianna, The Lady of Clockwork** her status as a doll isn't critical to what she has *become*. Additionally, if we look at the trailer, she was *transformed*, not *animated*, so it's possible that whatever magic created her did away with much of her doll-like natural.

Even then, we have some subtle nods to her origins:

* Her arm has a thin, spectral stitching line.
* Her tights are a combination of patchwork-like fabrics, with horizontal elements representing seams.

So her design has nods to her origin that remind us she was a doll and was magically transformed to her current state, but gives more visual space to what she is *now* and what she will be going *forward*. Deemphasizing her origin in her design is an acknowledgement that while it's how she came to be, it is *not* what *defines* her. She's not a champion because she's a magic doll -- she's a champion because of what she *became*, and *how she defines herself in the future*.

------------------------------

#Why Is She Cute?

* It helps to sell the wide-eyed, curious personality of an entity that never expected to be alive, and now is. From what little we have of her VO she seems joyful and excited to experience the world, and set on ensuring that it is not taken from her.
* It's an interesting juxtaposition with her spectral weapon and ties to the horrors of the Shadow Isles.
* It's not uncommon to imagine that if a child's toy were brought to life through magic, it would be appear as something cute and harmless rather than something ugly or creepy.
* Yes, Riot does know that attractive/cute champions tend to be popular, but I consider this simply one of several considerations that justify this appearance.

---------------------------------

#Bonus Question: Should She Have a 'Sown Chaos' or 'Ruined Gwen' Skin?

Absolutely. While I don't think Gwen as we see her characterized *should* be a creepy doll, I'll readily acknowledge that the desire for one is there, and since skins are designed as alternate fantasies a creepier, Shadow Isles-corrupted version of her would make an amazing skin that would appeal to a portion of the playerbase who wishes for a creepier doll champion. It would be a great compromise, and I hope Riot makes one.",2021-03-27 02:04:32,564.0,mduju7

6hk4g0dn,rxcardo,"Hey, everyone! I just wanted to share my very recent experience playing League. I first noticed a problem while playing against Brand: my basics suddenly stopped showing and I couldn't see Brand's W and E. In the following games, I've noticed that I randomly lose the ability to see auto attacks while they're in the air (this goes for caster minions as well), and I can't see anything that's on the ground, like Voli's E, the Scuttle ward, and even pings (I hear them, and they show up on the minimap, but I don't see them even when they're cast right on top of me.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? If so, is there any solution? I've tried both repatching and reinstalling the game using Hextech Repair Tool, but the issue persists. I've also sent a bug report to Riot and I'm awaiting a response. I'll probably update this post with their reply if this turns out to be a common problem.",2021-03-28 04:29:48,2.0,melz07
8cw61jzy,SpaghettiTime99,"I see ""riot, the indie company, which can't even balance a champion"" posts everywhere and I wonder where they come from.

I mean, the business goal is to make more people play as much games as possible. The more addicted player is the better.

Hard stomping enemies is what gives you dopamine rush so you don't want 150 balanced champions with 50% winrate each. You need to pick few and rotate them.

That way people have fun with abusing broken champions, play more, spend more money, invest themselves more. Then you change meta and repeat the cycle. The whole runes, builds, synergies, bans, counters, game plans change just because these exact champions are broken/useless this month.

It's what keeps the game fresh for 10+ years now. It's a bit disgusting if you dwell into it, but VERY effective.

You can resist and play your, let's say, 1 favourite jg champ all the time, but if he's much weaker than Hecarim/Udyr there's no way you're going to have fun with being crushed by him. You will win some, but lose a lot more probably (if you're normal casual player, not some smurf).

If you're addicted enough and desperate for wins you will break and play along. If you constantly lose to Yone, it's better to start playing him yourself and have fun.",2021-03-28 20:40:44,0.0,mf0pwg

tg08b,jackofjokers,"I'd say I started noticing it around the time xayah and rakan was released. Pretty girl/pretty boy designs for new champions, I thought oh okay, interesting choices, one off maybe? Then sexy anime protagonist emo kayn came out and i was like okay wtf is this, whats happening is this gonna be the norm? Just anime esque champion designs from now on? Then Ornn was released and was rest assured, we are back on track for interesting concepts lads.

&#x200B;

Then proceeds the next 16 out 18 champions following the same formula, sexy anime girl and hot half naked anime boy, cutesy shit. You don't believe me; since Rakan got released there has been a total of 9 male champions, and out of those 9 male champions, 6 are topless, and ripped. I'll let you think on that one.

&#x200B;

I was getting really annoyed, around the time Sett got released, a champion who I was genuinely excited for, I had taken a break from league at this period and was hoping it was gonna ignite my love for the game again. Then he gets released and my eyes man, my eyes what was I witnessing, sexy ripped cat ear furry LS looking motherfucker, an underground arena fighting mob boss looks like this, the potential for him was endless and this is what came out.

Anyway fast forward to Gwen released and I realised, after my initial and inevitable rants to my housemates about how Riot has let me down in the character design department once again, I realised whats happened. Think about it, character design was all about exploration, didn't matter what they looked like good or ugly sexy cute, cuz you could play around with aesthetic when making skins for them, that was what skins were about, fanservice basically. But somehow that ideology has seeped into the character design department because all these champions are fan service, the reason you might not see it is cuz Riot has some of the best lore writers, game developers, concept artists, VFX artists in the world, so all that fan service bollocks is hidden behind genuinely well made high quality shit.

The vfx, the concept art, the champion kits, the sound design are always and always was top quality and will continue to be so because Riot hasn't lost their way in those areas, but character design they have fallen short.

&#x200B;

And yes, I know they make more money from these boring as fuck looking weeabo designs but I wanted to voice my thoughts else I was gonna explode, cuz i love this game, been playing it like non stop for the past 7 years and no game has come close to that for me, League is near perfect (aside from the fact league is slowly becoming urf each season) Champion design is the one thing I care about most and the reason I fell in love with league to begin with, this immensely vast array of UNIQUE looking champions to choose from, is now heading in a direction I fear most.

I play a lot of support and warding tends to be a challenge for me. One of the biggest problems is warding around dragon or baron. When dragon or baron is up, naturally you would want to get it. So I want to set upwards for the team. The problem is that the enemy team already has complete vision control. So I am walking in darkness risking myself getting caught. (which happens a lot.) It would be helpful if I can get my team to walk with me so I can ward, but they are never there to provide support so I can ward without dying.

9vokx8ks,Forsaken-Pin-1328,"Hi everyone, this is my first post as i figured someone might be kind enough to  offer some advice. As the title implies, in seasons 8 and 9, I climbed to D3 on support, both seasons and D4 as an ADC.

My strongest supports are (in no particular order): lulu, janna, nami, rakan, pyke and galio (lol)

Nothing to write home about but I was pretty happy to get Diamond in two roles. I stopped playing due to IRL commitments, but would still play with friends very casually now and again. So mechanics somewhat in tact.

Since season 11 started, I've been playing casually and had a lot of fun and decided it might be worth trying to climb again, I decided to do it as support as that's always been my strongest role. So I ran a smurf and I'm really struggling at low plat/high gold and I'm not too sure why. I suspect the information edge I used to have over other players has dissipated. Everyone seems to know good ward spots now, how to ward defensively and aggressively, and overall utilise vision much more effectively which is something I used to be able to exploit and felt I had mastered quite well.

I guess I just don't know how to build an edge anymore. Better enemy warding (when I sweep they're always in all the good spots) seems to be leading to me roaming less effectively. In lane, it also feels like no matter how much of a lead I engineer for my ADC as support in lane, my ADC (through no fault of their own it seems) will often simply tickle a titan from the top lane, or just get rundown by a chemtank / oneshot by an assassin (or in the worst cases, both) irrespective of how far behind they are. 

Anyhow I'd be really grateful for any tips for a washed up veteran like myself. It could just be a case of me needing to play more, but if anyone has any noticeable information asymmetries they like to take advantage of, it would be much appreciated :)",2021-03-27 22:56:39,7.0,mefcll

91gcaoll,PsychopathicPoro,"Ok hear me out. I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like new Xin Zhao could make it as a viable engage support. Whenever I consider a weird pick like this, I try to think about two things. 

1. What would make X pick good at doing X
2. What makes X pick a more suitable choice than the current meta in certain scenarios

Ok so 1 is pretty easy to go over, so I’ll start with that. He has a fast engage that’s an aoe slow and he has a knockup. Once he hits six, he can use his ult to move the enemy in a preferable spot, like a melee Gragas ult. 

As for why he might be better than other engage supports, it’s a pretty simple reason. Leona, Alistar, and Rell are all meta engage supports right now, but they all have the same issue. Once they choose to go in, they’re stuck with their decision. Xin Zhao got a pretty massive range buff to his W E combo with the recent rework, and therefore after he lands a W, he actually has a choice. Yes, timing the knockup will be a higher skill cap, but sometimes the slow is all you need, and you don’t actually have to commit to the engage until you know it’s good. I can imagine a Xin Zhao landing a W in lane and then deciding not to use E after a second thought, where a similar situation with Leona E or Alistar headbutt would stick them into an unpreferrable fight. 
Also on a more obvious note, Xin Zhao is an early game ganker when he jungles, so in theory his early support roams should be pretty effective as well

I would imagine Xin Zhao support rushing any of the following 4 items 
Locket/chemtank if he doesn’t need damage and just wants engage 
Umbral if he wants a little damage and vision control
Possibly Shurelya for the same engage idea, it has gotten buffs in recent memory so it could be good
And I also had the thought that Imperial Mandate is definitely playable because of the cheap cost and his new AP ratios, and would probably be what I would run if I tried it

Basically tldr; due to the recent mini-rework, Xin Zhao support is an engage support with the ability to pick and choose engages with a freedom other supports can’t, and a high skill expression with timing Q knockups or R displacements could be a big factor in teamfights on the same level as other meta supports",2021-03-27 21:43:43,7.0,mee1vk

# Long version

Ranked is some kind of competitive playing. Like you want to climb up and play vs. Players who can match your knowledge and your mechanics. People like to challenging each other and its ok to do it. 

Because its a sport. League of legends competitive is a sport and everyone knows the feeling of loosing because your team played poorly or you played poorly as an individuum. 

Yeah, in theory, ranked is competitive. 

But thats not the truth at all. In the actual part, playing ranked, it is everything but competitive. 

People dont wanna think too much about the team composition, or about wave management etc. 

In theory, a quinn can counter a sion very hard. BUT if you dont know how to play quinn you will get fcked up very hard. Do my teammates care about this? NO. Why they should? Riot doesnt punish this type of playing. Im speaking about punish because these players are ruining the competitive soul of the game. They dont care when they go into rankeds. 

People arent ready to play ranked when they hit lv 30. They just arent. 

Please do an expanded tutorial for players which they have to play. If you wanna play competitive, you have enough time to practice before and doing tutorials. (1-2h tutorial to understand some concepts of the game.) they are even several youtubers who already did intense tutorials for mastering the game, ask them to help create a nice tutorial (is it so hard?) 

I dont wanna say im a good player, im not. My peak was platin 3. 

But its frustrating to play with players who actually dont care about anything. 

&#x200B;

>Do riot care about this? Nah.   
>  
>Do riot want to make money? Yes.   
>  
>Do riot plays with the frustration of the players? YES THEY DO

Thats so poorly from riot games aka tenCenT that they want to bury the competitive soul of an average player. You dont need to be perkz or faker to have the will to play ranked. Everyone wants to get better in this game, but how the fuck , where should i get the motivation when every ranked is a disaster in terms of almost everything. Go play normal if you dont care about this game, but please gtfo of my rankeds if you wanna troll or „first time vayne top“ .

>\- Aura base damage increased to 50 / 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 / **300** from 40 / 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240.

&#x200B;

You guys dont care, and its somehow okay, because you cant balance every of the (145?) champions perfectly so you can always pick everything, its utopian. 

I could name 200 examples, but this one made me going insane. Its too much. I mean, im a monkey sometimes, but you guys make decisions almost 10-11 million active players have to deal with.

# Seraphine 

Seraphine is the perfect example of how riot makes money. 

&#x200B;

>Sona is popular and has a lot of supporters around the world who like to play her. Its a simple gameplay but effective. So we can put alot of expensive skins for her? Right? Yeah 

But people are tired of playing the same champ. If we rework her, people could still play their skins and also have a „new“ champ to explore with and have fun with her, right? Yeah, seems logical. 

Instead of riot released „Seraphine“. Her kit is the most broken one in league of legends by far. 

Its like sonas skill kit, but better. Lets be honest pls riot games. (tEnCeNT)

Hmm, how much does her (only one!!!) skin cost? 

3250 rp. In my country, i need to play 25€ for this. Thats so bullshit like wtf can i trade my sona skins maybe? No? Hmm, anyways. 

You guys are ripping off people and ruining the game. Please make drastically changes. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These are only some words came in my mind to this topics. But im frustrated as a active player (wasted 8 years). Nowadays its some kind of capitalistic fucked up shit and they dont care about the players at all. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just a player from your game who wants to help making league of legends competitive. 

(please correct me if im wrong somewhere, i will read comments and try to understand the criticism and yeah, lets have a discuss!)

Supp had clearly never played before and even openly admitted to this. Her friend was terrible to a point you'd also think it was his first time playing (and griefed hard). 

The rest of the team reported jg for griefing and being toxic as he deserved but support, while reported for feeding, just felt not right. If you're brand new and your friend adds you to a ranked game and you don't know better - that's not your fault, but the whole team suffers for it. 

I played a lot until 2018 and then took a break till last summer and practiced a bit again before playing ranked again. It seems though that nowadays, this game as a good example, just anyone can join ranked. Is there no longer a minimum level you have to have to play ranked? Its incredibly unfair to unsuspected teammates playing ranked if everyone is taking the game seriously, and at least vaguely knows what they're doing, but then has someone who's so clueless and feeds hard.

Since all my friends dont play anymore Iam playing solo 90% of the time. I use Porofessor to check the players and from 7/10 games, I play with a full random team or maybe one duo BUT the enemy team is a full premade team of 5 people.

Just today I played 4 games and in all 4 games in a row, we were 5 randoms against a full premade team.

Doesn't the matchmaking check those stuff? I found a game after 10-25s so it can't be because no one wants to start a game.

And most of the time, the rankeds and mmr doesn't even add up. I played 2 placements so far and am ranked in Bronze 2. My mates are like gold/platin and we play against high diamond player.

3r7tq4at,HardstuckPlasticV,"The previous Ryze version was one of my favorite characters. Not just in League, but across all the games I've played. I loved the quick combos, close range, and decent durability that combined to create a fun and unique combat style. 

The 9.12 patch (and, more recently, the S11 preseason) have hit this ""battlemage""-type combat fantasy hard, shifting power elsewhere. To put it mildly, I don't agree with that. Some players like end result just as much (if not more), which is fine; that's totally subjective, and I'm not here to tell people what they should or shouldn't enjoy about Ryze. 

I am trying to create a kit concept that would push him out of pro play without compromising on the battlemage playstyle that drew me (as well as many others) to him in the first place. I'm looking for feedback to improve it (you might have seen my previous posts, which have all been for the same purpose). 

There is zero context in the post itself, I keep a separate FAQ post (linked at the bottom) for that. Check that out first if you have concerns or questions, they might be covered there. 

&#x200B;

\-------------------------

**TLDR:** Autos deal mana-scaling damage to minions/structures. Basic ability mana scalings are removed. Ryze has a new passive, The Scroll, which stores damage to be converted into shields. The rune charge system is removed, but Q resets remain. W minion kills refund mana. Roots are EWQ. Autospread is removed, and WE spreads flux. The ultimate is restructured, with a ramp-up combat passive and kill-based warp activation. 

&#x200B;

\-------------------------

#  Basic Attack

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 500.

\- PASSIVE: Auto-attacks deal an extra \[10 + 1.5% maximum mana\] damage to minions and structures.

&#x200B;

\---------------------

# Passive: The Scroll

&#x200B;

\- Ryze stores 50% of post-mitigation damage from enemy Champions in The Scroll, up to \[150-420 + 15% bonus mana\]. Only damage to his health counts.

Overload casts drain \[50-140 + 5% bonus mana\] stored damage (if available) to give a 2-second shield for the same amount.

Overloads less than 2 seconds apart remove & refresh this shield.

Stored damage decays out of combat (100% -> 0% in 15 seconds).

&#x200B;

\----------------------

# Q: Overload

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 1000

\- CAST TIME: 0.2

\- COST: 40 mana

\- COOLDOWN: 6 seconds

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze unleashes a runic blast in the target direction, dealing magic damage to the first enemy struck.

&#x200B;

\- DAMAGE: \[80/110/140/170/200\] + \[65% AP\]

&#x200B;

\- PASSIVE: Ryze's other basic abilities reset Overload's cooldown.

&#x200B;

\- SPELL FLUX: If Overload hits a Spell Fluxed target (EQ), it repeats the the damage from Spell Flux, consumes the mark, and spreads to all nearby enemies marked with Spell Flux.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s08380mujjp61.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8f0cdef8fbae91188f71d4f9c44ba3e00c6e57

\- UNSTABLE FLUX: If Overload hits an Unstable Fluxed target (WQ), it instantly applies the remaining damage and consumes the mark.

&#x200B;

\- PRISON FLUX: If Overload hits a Prison Fluxed target (EWQ), it instantly applies the remaining damage, roots the target for 1.75 seconds, and consumes the mark. Consecutive Prison Flux roots on a single target are 1.25 seconds.

\[IMAGE UNDER W SECTION\]

&#x200B;

\------------------------

# W: Unstable Flux / Prison Flux

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 500

\- CAST TIME: 0.2

\- COST: 40/55/70/85/100 mana

\- COOLDOWN: 9/8.5/8/7.5/7.

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze traps the target enemy, dealing them magic damage every 0.25 seconds over 1.5 seconds and slowing them by 40% for the duration. Minions below 30 HP are executed.

&#x200B;

\- TOTAL DAMAGE: \[60/80/100/120/140\] + \[60% AP\]

&#x200B;

PASSIVE: If Unstable Flux kills a minion, Ryze regenerates:

\[6-11 (based on level)\] mana every 0.5 seconds over 10 seconds, 120-220 total

\[2-6 (based on level)\] health every 0.5 seconds over 10 seconds, 40-120 total

NOTE: He can last-hit Unstable Fluxed minions with autos for the same effect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- SPELL FLUX: Casting on Spell Flux (EW) creates ""Prison Flux"". This deals the same damage as Unstable Flux but slows by 20%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jue6x012kjp61.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b62a0b969cd96707100196d2ffb85cdad14139

\----------------------

# E: Spell Flux

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 500

\- CAST TIME: 0.2

\- SPREAD RADIUS: 375

\- COST: 40/55/70/85/100 mana

\- COOLDOWN: 3/2.75/2.5/2.25/2

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze hurls an orb of runic energy at an enemy, dealing them magic damage. The target is marked for 3 seconds.

&#x200B;

\- DAMAGE: \[30 + 5-60 (based on level)\] + \[20% AP\]

&#x200B;

\- UNSTABLE FLUX: Spell Flux spreads when cast on Unstable Flux (WE). This consumes W, removing the slow and instantly applying the remaining damage. The flux spread damages all targets.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0j893y7dkjp61.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=458297478ac922e631a1a9a978d7846456778830

\--------------------------

# R: Desperate Power / Realm Warp

&#x200B;

\- PASSIVE: During combat with champions, basic abilities on-cast grant a *Desperate Power* stack. Each stack gives 1/2/3 Ability Haste and 3/4.5/6 movement speed for 4 seconds. This refreshes on subsequent casts and stacks up to 10 times (10/20/30 Ability Haste, 30/45/60 movement speed).

At full stacks (10 casts), abilities on-hit explode in an AoE around the target (150 radius), reducing MR by 4% (up to 20%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4udd9mgfkjp61.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc9f5925a6be672dbd4c8de5fa81850c4bd98173

\-----

\- PASSIVE: If Ryze kills an enemy champion, he is granted a cast of Realm Warp for 30 seconds. This does not stack.

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 1000 (minimum) / 3000 (maximum)

\- CAST TIME: None

\- COST: None

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze opens a 350-width portal on the ground at his current location and channels for 1.5 seconds. Upon successfully completing the channel, he will blink to the target location, becoming rooted, disarmed, silenced, and untargetable for 0.75 seconds.

Ryze can move around and cast spells during this channel, which can be interrupted by both silencing and immobilizing effects.

&#x200B;

7nuegcug,turbomonkeys,"League Needs More Communication.

I am a huge advocate for voice comms being added to LoL, and here I want to provide the counterarguments against the addition of voice comms, and answer them in a fair, full manner. I am not an avid Reddit user in the slightest, so I apologize if the format suffers a little. This is just what I believe to be the optimal place to post my opinion, as I want this game to change for the better.

**""Toxicity will increase in LoL due to the addition of voice comms"":**

It's purely a bad argument if you think about it for more than two seconds. Voice comms exist in pretty much every single other competitive video game. The mute option has existed since the beginning of time. Toxicity will exist either way, through text or through voice. But let me give you the crux of my argument. I actually believe toxicity would be reduced drastically due to the addition of voice communication. Here is why:

**1)** *It is less likely in most scenarios that players will speak aloud the things that they type in game*. Voices add a much more human factor to the game. There are some nut-jobs that will flame no matter what, I understand. But the mute button exists for a reason, as they likely have nothing valuable to contribute anyways. People will be a lot more willing to work together as a team when they actually get to talk with their teammates, and will lead to more cohesive, enjoyable, and overall higher level League of Legends.

**2)** *Communication.* I watch a lot of LoL streamers, and I have noticed the amount of frustration and tilt that roots from miscommunication and poor/misunderstood calls in-game. Small things that cannot be typed in the moment can end a game in a matter of seconds, and longer, more complicated calls that a teammate that isn't playing Yuumi cannot afford to sit and type for 20-30 seconds.

**3)** *Fun.* Seriously. I get that not everyone is the social type. I understand that not everyone gets the same enjoyable social experience from video games the same way I do. But I believe that a majority of players have more to gain than lose with the addition of voice communication.

**4)** *Learning*. There are so many small and big things I have learned from just watching other players. But putting the microscope on low ELO, which has the largest skill differential, as it is also the bulk of the LoL community, could benefit a TON from the better players helping along the worse players, and spreading information and habits to make the entirety of the LoL low ELO environment higher-quality. Players will less likely allow their ego to intervene over voice, as well.

To summarize, toxicity is a problem, yes, but I believe that there is nothing but net gain if voice comms are added to LoL, with proper implementation and moderation. There is so much more to gain from voice comms, even with some downsides. Toxicity is the main counterargument against voice comms, although I really do believe it is a really weak one, so I will look into others I have come up with.

**""With things like Bottom Lane duo, and Jungle ganks, the voice communication environment can feel really crowded."":**

This is a pretty weak argument, but one that I still think should be looked at, because if there are too many voices going on in the comms, it can lead to tilt or discomfort, which is the opposite of what we're trying to achieve here. Riot Games is a very creative company, and I am sure they can come up with a solution to this problem, such as certain hotkeys to mute and unmute players at will. Plus this won't be a problem in every game, anyway.

**""Language Barriers"":**

Yeah, this one makes a lot of sense, actually, I just want to acknowledge it here though. The problem with providing a counter argument to things like these is because as opposed to making a long and complicated argument, I can just say ""Hey, other games have Voice Comms, just add it"". Language barriers can be a huge problem in some regions compared to others, but I don't believe that should restrain this game's potential.

I literally ran out of reasons, because most of them are pretty bad and just clutter this already lengthy post. Stuff like ""what if a player doesn't own a microphone or headset? Then they would be at a serious disadvantage"". But these are strawmans due to the fact that every other game has voice comms regardless, even Riot's own other game, VALORANT. That's what makes this post so hard to compose, honestly.

***To summarize the entirety of this post, I believe that voice comms should be added to LoL for a variety of reasons, and honestly Riot should have added voice comms a long, long time ago. I believe that toxicity would be reduced, and that game quality and the game's community would improve a drastic amount. My arguments are obviously provided above, and I would love to give a counterargument to anyone who has a point that I may have missed. Thank you for taking your time reading this far. Have a great day/night!***",2021-03-28 06:22:56,0.0,meo6ft

1gkxa802,Nightlure,"Hello and welcome to my post/discussion/question.

I've been playing since season 7, and I was an Akali main (pre-rework) and I was really into league, I kept playing like 3 daily games every season. Akali rework arrived, I I was sad for losing my favorite champion, but I really loved (and still love) the new Akali.

Then the nerfs came, she lost her w total invisibility (a deserved one), her Q heal (I still hate that nerf, it was a reminder of classic Akali healing) and the rest of them.

In conclusion, losing my champ and getting a nerfed or permaban champ took a bit of my interest away.

Then the last season came, in its moment I hated the drakes changes, my playtime changed to 2 or 3 games at the week. 

I started to like the season changes, but I had a lot of things to do (studies and so), so I stopped playing league. 

Now into the present, I want to play again, but I'm kinda ""scared"" about the new items and Akali's actual situation, cause I don't know anything about both of them. I'm always thinking that if I play I will be destroyed and int, cause I lost all my Akali's mechanics (and general mechanics) and I don't know how to build myself. 

I would love to heard some similar experiences, some thought or tips, or anything you want to share.

agkw9ux3,newriley,"I just watched that riot pls video (IK I'm late on it) where they talk about adding more comeback mechanics and I have to say I disagree. Most people just give up way too early and refuse to play from behind.

This season I feel like I've won more games from behind than any other season. This is because with the sheer amount of shut down gold in the game, coupled with how unsafe and greedy people play when ahead, it's extremely easy to make a comeback off of one mid-late game team-fight. The problem is most players opt out of turtling and waiting for a good fight and instead would rather fight over and over again despite being behind in items and XP, which in turn puts them even FARTHER behind.

I want to compare what would happen with more comeback mechanics to a game I used to play 5 years ago. This game was called Vainglory, and at the time it was only a 3v3 MOBA. The DEV team added a ton of comeback mechanics because players felt like the game was too much of a snowball fest. But by adding more comeback mechanics, it made it almost too easy to comeback. The winning team had to play almost perfectly or risk throwing their lead with one death because of the sheer amount of shutdown gold.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that players need to stop treating this game like a team death match. If you're behind stop fighting over and over again, instead focus on getting to your item spikes, putting down defensive vision (which will help you get picks), and most importantly give dragons if you have to and wait until you have a decent window to take a fight.",2021-03-27 04:49:04,102.0,mdy3wa

lloq28j,-AMAG,"With the introduction of Season 11's item rework, almost every item in the game has been changed significantly. A really common complaint by [mage players](https://clips.twitch.tv/SuspiciousFlirtyDiamondYouWHY-2h3pA4lDsA5giYjg) is that the class feels significantly worse than it did in previous seasons because it feels like the class lacks damage unless you ONLY move towards damage options. Is this actually a valid complaint? Values given are on Patch 11.6. TL;DR of item changes at the end.

&#x200B;

**Luden's Echo -> Luden's Tempest:**

\- Lost 10 AP

\- 20% CDR converted to 20 Ability Haste (insanely large nerf)

\- Combine cost increased by 200 gold

\- Gained 6 Magic Penetration

\- Mythic Passive of 5 magic penetration

&#x200B;

Pretty clearly a massive nerf to Luden's, flat magic penetration does not scale exceptionally well and that's the only benefit that Tempest has over its predecessor. Now, Luden's costs more, has less AP, and doesn't even give 20 ability haste instead of %CDR until the item is completed

&#x200B;

**Archangel's Staff / Seraph's Embrace:**

\- Gained 15 AP

\- Tear is now a 400 gold item

\- Lost 20% CDR

\- Lost Seraph's shield active

\- Lost (150/550) Mana

\- Increased Awe passive AP gain by 2% (from 3% to 5% on Seraph's and from 1% to 3% on Archangel's)

\- Removed the 25% refund from using abilities

\- Combine cost reduced by 200 gold

\- Needlessly Large Rod and an Amplifying Tome replaces the Lost Chapter.

&#x200B;

Seraph's got cheaper and now gives more AP in a standard build (The mana reduction on Seraph's reduces its own AP gain). However, it lost a ton of CDR, the defensive shield active, and the mana refund on hits. The build path is worse than it was before, and it isn't really a viable first item either.

&#x200B;

**Banshee's Veil:**

&#x200B;

\- 5 AP gain.

\- Loses 15 Magic Resist

\- Cost reduced by 400 Gold

\- Loses 10% CDR for 10 Ability Haste

\- Verdant Barrier replaces Blasting Wand and a Null Magic Mantle.

&#x200B;

This item was straight up buffed, although the 10% CDR was really valuable because Lost Chapter item + Transcendence + Banshee's Veil = 40% CDR. Still not often taken over Zhonya's Hourglass because the latter's active is far better in more situations.

&#x200B;

**Void Staff**:

&#x200B;

\- Lost 5 Ability Power

\- Costs 50 gold more

\- Blighting Jewel component is added

&#x200B;

Void Staff is basically the same as last season, better buildpath but worse when completed

&#x200B;

**Dark Seal / Mejai's Soulstealer**:

\- Gained 5 AP on Dark Seal

\- 2 more AP per Glory stack on Dark Seal

\- Removed additional healing on potions

\- (100/200) mana exchanged for (40/100) health

\- Upgrade to Mejai's costs 200 more

&#x200B;

Dark Seal is better with Glory stacks now, Mejai's is worse. Additional healing removal makes Dark Seal a worse starting item than in previous seasons.

&#x200B;

**Seeker's Armguard:**

\- Costs 100 gold less

\- Loses 15 AP and 15 Armour when fully stacked

\- Loses additional cloth armour in combine path

&#x200B;

It's literally just worse, losing 15 armour and 15 AP is not worth 100 less gold, and the combine path is worse because you can't buy 2 cloth armours in a really rough lane.

&#x200B;

**Zhonya's Hourglass:**

\- Costs 300 gold less

\- Lost 10 AP

\- 10% CDR to 10 Ability Haste

&#x200B;

Worse statswise but being able to get the active faster might make the difference in a fight.

&#x200B;

**Morellonomicon:**

&#x200B;

\- Loses 50 Health

\- Combine cost down 500 gold

\- 10 more AP

\- Access to Grievous Wounds earlier through the 800 gold oblivion orb component

\- Loses 15 magic penetration

&#x200B;

15 flat penetration from the 1600 gold oblivion orb provided a ton of early damage against targets with no magic resist, however every other relevant change is a direct buff.

&#x200B;

**Rylai's Crystal Scepter:**

&#x200B;

\- Costs 400 more gold

\- Gains 50 health

\- Slow increased 10%

\- Giant's Belt replaces Ruby Crystal

&#x200B;

The item is buffed but not really enough to justify a massive cost increase. Rushing this item feels far worse now.

&#x200B;

**Rabadon's Deathcap:**

&#x200B;

\- Lost 5% AP amplification

&#x200B;

Literally just worse.

&#x200B;

**Hextech Protobelt -> Hextech Rocketbelt:**

&#x200B;

\- 700 gold cost increase

\- 10% CDR to 15 Ability Haste

\- Gain 50 HP

\- Gain 30 AP

\- Bolts no longer scale with level, and their AP ratio is reduced by 10%

\- Gain movespeed towards enemies when using the active

\- Worse at clearing waves (I don't really understand why because there's no real mention of this in the patchnotes)

\- 5 flat magic penetration mythic passive

&#x200B;

Sort of a sidegrade, the item is generally better but costs a LOT more.

&#x200B;

**Nashor's Tooth:**

&#x200B;

\- Gains 20 AP

\- Loses 20% CDR

\- Gains +5AP% bonus on-hit magic damage

\- Stinger + Fiendish Codex buildpath is replaced by Recurve Bow + Blasting Wand + Amp Tome

&#x200B;

Losing 20% CDR really hurts, even 20 AP and a slight increase to the AP ratio is not really comparable.

&#x200B;

**Lich Bane:**

&#x200B;

\- Loses 10 AP

\- Costs 200 gold less

\- Gains 3% movespeed (7% -> 10%)

\- AP ratio on the Spellblade attack is 10% less

\- 75% base AD to 150% base AD on Spellblade proc

\- Loses 250 Mana

\- Loses 10% CDR

&#x200B;

Liandry's Torment and Liandry's Anguish are sadly not really comparable since one is a mana item. I will compare Torment to Demonic Embrace as their passives are far more similar.

&#x200B;

**Liandry's Torment -> Demonic Embrace:**

&#x200B;

\- Demonic Embrace: 1.2% max health as total magic damage per second over 4 seconds if you hit an opponent. Liandry's Torment: 0.75% max health as total magic damage per half a second over 3 seconds.

\- Demonic Embrace passive loses double damage on slowed / immobilized units

\- Loses 5 AP

\- Does not have Liandry's Torment Madness passive

\- 50 more health

\- Gains 10 bonus armour and MR while passive is active, gaining 2.5 more for each affected champion

\- 100 gold cheaper

\- Buildpath is just worse.

&#x200B;

This is just significantly worse, because losing the 10% damage amp from the madness passive is really large compared to any of the benefits this item has over Liandry's.

&#x200B;

**New items:** Everfrost, Horizon Focus, Liandry's Anguish, Night Harvester, Cosmic Drive, Riftmaker

&#x200B;

**Old Items:** Hextech GLP-800, Hextech Gunblade, Rod of Ages, Spellbinder, Twin Shadows

&#x200B;

It's very difficult to compare items that don't serve the same purpose as items last season. Everfrost is strong at the moment but was just massively buffed recently. Liandry's Anguish and Nightharvester are popular items this season, but the remainder of new items I see less commonly. Doesn't mean they are bad but they are less applicable in a lot of situations. GLP was popular on close range skillshot champs like Veigar and Ahri, Gunblade was popular and strong on mid lane assassins like Katarina and Akali, and Rod of Ages was commonly used on scaling mages like Kassadin and Ryze. Spellbinder and Twin Shadows were much less common, although the latter was used often in combination with the GLP builds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**On mythic passives:** Ability Haste mythic passive is literally just worse on full build mages than a Lost Chapter item / Lich Bane standard purchase last season. At full build on Magic Penetration mythic passives you get 4/10 (Rocketbelt / Ludens) more flat magic penetration than previous seasons than if you just purchased Oblivion Orb in Season 10. Full build Riftmaker gives 1% more omnivamp and 32 AP more than Hextech Gunblade.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**Worse:** Luden's Tempest, Seraphs Embrace, Mejai's Soulstealer, Seeker's Armguard, Oblivion Orb, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Rabadon's Deathcap, Nashor's Tooth, Demonic Embrace

&#x200B;

**About the Same / Large Power Shift:** Void Staff, Dark Seal, Zhonya's Hourglass, Morellonomicon, Hextech Rocketbelt, Lich Bane

&#x200B;

**Better:** Banshee's Veil",2021-03-27 05:24:57,79.0,mdyufo

sometimes if there's more than two champions on my screen I won't be able to tell which one is me

Sometimes l just stand there because I can't make a decision.

[Man these were some tough losses. Bot lane seems to be a serious problem when trying to carry in this game and most of the above losses can be attributed to that single lane. \(I mean it's pretty hard to win when the enemy Tristana is 19\/4.\) Jungle diff is another problem I had in these games with my jungler getting about five dragons over the course of them. I find myself unable to carry in these situations.

2qcitoz3,cetbetancourt,"Most of the champions that take Divine right now are champions that want access to the spellblade effect, but can’t really make use of the excessive attack speed that Trinity gives (ex: GP, Nasus, Illaoi, Yorick)

With the changes to Trinity Force next patch, it is likely going to overshadow Sunderer in nearly all situations for nearly all its users. 

The reason being that the Sunderer %max HP spellblade still does less than the TF spellblade until the hyper late game, unless it’s against something like a Cho’Gath or Sion

Same goes for the mythic passive; it’s only noticeable until several items into your build. 

The only thing that Divine has going for it is its healing, which can be countered by a simple bramble vest. 

So here’s a proposed change to give make Divine let Divine stand its own against Trinity: let the healing proc on any non-structures, not just champions. 

This change would not add any combat benefit, but having access to some passive sustain would be very valuable for some champions that can’t really build lifesteal/omnivamp effectively. On the other hand, it also would be small enough that it wouldn’t be broken on a champion like Yasuo, who already stacks lifesteal

The healing should work as a percentage of the pre-mitigation damage dealt (exactly how it works on champions right now): 50/30% for melee/ranged. This ensures that the heal is not massive against epic monsters or super minions, as the damage is capped at 250% base AD against those targets

God help you if you're the jungler responsible for herding cats, because you will get flamed from the second anyone feeds first blood to an early gank, or likewise if you get invaded on and no one rotates to help you.

Jungle is super dependent on mid and top for scuttle control and objective control. Its as if your outcome of jungling highly depends on your teams map awareness and lane priority. Games where enemy team helps their jungle early and rotate i lose most times and games where my mid and top rotate, i usually win. Get double scuttle and have a level advantage or vice versa.

Biggest overall difference which I appreciate is on the official cast it feels like more often than not casters are just speculating for reasons a player went a certain build or made a certain play where on Doublelift's co-cast more times than not they know they exact reason something was done with past experience to back it up.

On top of the great analysis you also get a lot of interesting stories from the pro scene that I've never heard before. Random stuff like stories from team interactions living together, scrims, etc. that you would never know about if it didn't come from their discussion.

2r3fzc3l,RiftHunter4,"Compared to any other position, ADC is easily the weakest in Solo Q. Especially if you play a marksman. ADC's don't have a lot of good roaming potential compared to other roles, so it's harder to affect the other lanes directly. The result is that you can crush it during landing phase only to find that top or mid fed 8 times in the first 10 minutes of the game.

And so I see 2 scenarios the most often in playing ADC Solo Q:
1. Top feeds and now the enemy team has a fed tank that you can't kill.
2. Mid feeds and now you have a mage or assassin who will try to one-shot you every team fight (because the game is still pretty bursty).

Heaven help you if they both feed. You can overcome these scenarios, but it's gonna be hard AF most of the time and if you have multiple dunce caps on your team, it's probably GG.

Compare this with Mid or Top. Mid has loads of roaming potential and can pretty much help anywhere its needed. Top can cover top jungle and Baron pit, and can occasionally teleports bot. Those are also solo lanes. If your support goes 0/6 in laning, it's not your problem (yet). And if bot lane feeds, a decent mid can usually delete the ADC in most fights or Top can distract them while they get clubbed by the rest of the team (seriously. Stop focusing the tank every fight, guys).

But despite all this, they really can't afford to buff ADC's and especially not marksmen. With a coordinated team, Marksmen ADC's turn rabid and start killing everyone. You get vision where you need it and people generally respond faster to get you set up. If they buffed those roles, everyone would basically be fighting to get the most fed ADC and then watch as they 1v9 in a snowballing frenzy (and it already gets that way sometimes).

I don't know how you'd make Solo Q less painful for bot lane. We have drakes but Junglers and Mid have more sway over that in most scenarios. Just another example that the only way to win is to not play League lol.

EDIT: Learn to read. Nowhere did I say ADC is weak, it's just terrible for climbing in Solo Q and can feel worse in bad team dynamics than other roles.",2021-03-28 17:46:41,0.0,meyeni

That is a subjective view on the players that do that. What works for one person doesn't necessarily translate to another player. There are plenty of players that play all the different ways. Locked, unlocked, and both. Everyone should be playing what works for them not for what someone says is the best.

pinky on shift, wring on Q, middle on W, pointer on E and pointer moves to R and E/D when needed. I always got made fun of that way of me playing.

Kind of sucks since I was very actice and always went onto the server to get into ranked flex teams or in draft lobbies.",2021-04-03 15:03:04,0.0,mj3fos

aqeht,iratus412,"In an effort to prevent hostage taking by multiple people queuing as a team for One For All, it would be nice if Riot put in a reduction factor for people playing in groups.

You: Random Dude

4 Queue: We want Ivern. We all pick Ivern even if you don't want to play Ivern.

You now have an 80% chance playing Ivern.

Solution to fix:

You: Random Dude

4 Queue: We want Ivern. We will all pick Ivern.

SCRIPT: Detects 4 players queued together have all picked the same champion to skew the chance. Chance to play Ivern reduced to 50%. You now have a coin flip on getting trolled by the 4 stack or playing someone else you want to play. 

&#x200B;

Why should this happen? You should just accept it and play the game: I'm sorry but no, that's hostage taking. This happened in a previous game with Rell. People intentionally being assholes in a fun game mode need these kinds of checks in place to not make it a nightmare for other people, or the dodge penalty needs to be removed from 'for fun' game modes. Same for Leaverbuster. Getting trolled in a 'for fun' game mode by people who just want to make you suffer is the ultimate feels bad because you can do nothing to avoid getting reported for afking, leaving, feeding, etc. unless you A) mute the game before saying anything and B) play the game under duress.",2021-04-03 07:42:12,0.0,miwozx

3tmhull8,__BurNing,"I don't know if it's the aftermath of COVID, shortage of oxygen, or cosmic rays scrambling people's brain waves--but something is wrong. League of Legends has turned into a TOXIC COINFLIP simulator. It's like there is a MINIMUM of 1 player in over 80% of games who has the largest ego and does one of the following: belittles their team (flame to no end), intentionally feeding, literally giving up by 5 min, or the classic 'refusing to play but not afk' bit. All to prove a point that ""I don't care, this is my alt"" Or ""You deserve to lose this, cya"". Sure we can mute, so what. I could care less what people type on a video game, but I would REALLY love a button that disables team griefing such as AFK/inting/trolling/etc.

On top of the blatant exponential rise of toxicity and egotistical maniacs, it seems majority of games are simply just coinflips. One team is heavily dominating the other and that is absolutely over 50% of my games at least. It is rare now to see a decent matchup where someone is not griefing and or both teams are equally matched in skill. There are games where an entire team is plat, while the other are golds and the plat team gets absolutely destroyed. 

Just for fun I decided to record my last 10 games played and note the overall kill disparity + any blatant  negative activity to include how many reports I had to make that game: 

DATE          TIME     W/L  OVERALL KILLS              NOTES                                # REPORTS

* 4/2/2021 - 02:32 PM - L - 6-25 - Top flaming jg cause he was autofilled. Abandoned the match at \~14 min (no lp reduction? cool) - 1 report

&#x200B;

Just from these 10 games 7/10 of the games where just pure stomps. No contest. That being a massive team diff or someone inting/leaving. Over 70% of games are just coinflips... 80% of games resulted in at least 1 report. 

I have over 500 games this season... yikes. I can confidently say this sample size of 10 games is TYPICAL of what those 500 games consisted of. Being generous here but probably \~70 of those 500 games were actually decent, fair, matches, win or loss. 

I've played League of Legends since Season 4 and ended in Diamond for the last 4 seasons... Sure there have always been griefers/trolls in every video game. But season 11 takes the cake, it's a seispool of toxicity and trolls and egotistical maniacs. I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this but it's absolutely insane and I'm questioning if RIOT is actually doing anything about this. The. Reports. Never. End.

7qj10ggm,DOLFYtheCAMP3R,"Im kinda new to league (3 Months player). And im currently searching for a champ to main. But im always scared of maining a champion then he gets nerfed to the ground.

For example Yorick was like D tier 3 weeks ago or so, and now he is S or S+ tier in low elo. And now They gonna neft him again; basically juggling him all over the place, and its hard to get used to a champion if he is always changed.

Another example is Azir where he was once extremely powerful and now he is like E tier if there was even an E tier. Well yea you could say that he is powerful in pro play, but 99% of players or more are not participating in pro-play.

Then we have random buffs for Katarina even though she is already powerful.

Now I fear stable picks like Garen - Darius - Malphite will randomly get nerfed to the ground and have their mains crying.

I know balancing a game is almost impossible. But what I am asking is for consistency, like a champion should be a certain tier and not climb or demote several tiers at a single patch like what we saw with Yorick and Azir.

I honestly like the way the balanced hecarim and udyr. They nerfed them while still not slaughtering them.

I wanna see the same thing with Azir - Yorick - Singed - Trundle and other champs that I never see in solo Q.

98x6fnh8,Original_Forever_476,"Notice how I didn't say ""more fun"" because for sure getting 5 kills in 7 minutes is fun... for you... and only for you..  but completely frustrating for your opponent. 

See the problem with marksmen like Kai sa / Samira / Tristana  is that they eliminate the purpose of ADC in a few ways. 
•They have an extremely good early game 
•They have low range 

Typically,  ADCs are supposed to be long range late game carries. Of course there can be exceptions and not every ADC has to have high range, but when those ""atypical"" ADCs become meta, that's where I personally  draw the line. 

When playing against Samira you should be greatful  you died 5 times during the laning phase instead of the usual 7 times. Having kill preasure right from level 2 (or 1) as an ADC is off limits. I want to farm my 2 item power-spike for 20 minutes then pop off and start fighting. But gosh this Samira wort stop challenging me for a duel.  ADCs aren't supposed to fight that much and try to get that many kills early. 

I AM NOT A BOT MAIN HOW DOES BOT META AFFECT ME?:: Glad you asked, well, have you heard of a common phenomenon known us ""bot-diff""? Are you tired of hearing every 2 minutes ""An ally has been slayed"" from your bot? So let's say that your bot has to feed and its unavoidable, at least champions like Ashe and Varus have a clear kill window at level 6, therefore the chances of your bot actually feeding before that are low whereas when playing against trist they are probably gonna run it down since minute 2/level 1 hence making it harder for you to carry yourself out of silver.",2021-04-03 08:25:24,0.0,mixgy9

68kam3x4,fightingpaintballs22,"How do we fix Worlds without making it longer than a month and not add to what must be a logistical nightmare?
How do we get a more definitive ranking of region performance and decrease variation?

If you like the following plan, would recommend any changes, or find a fundamental flaw, please tell me!

My main assumption is that we want more opportunities for top teams to play each other and minimise the opportunities for teams to get knocked out by teams from their own region.

Substitute the group stage with a 16-team Swiss System tournament (a team qualifies for the knockout stage when it wins 4 matches, and it has a total of 7 matches to do so), which leads to teams playing 4-7 games so on average 5.5 games (instead of a fixed 6 games per team) per team, and with waterfall scheduling easily fits in the two weeks set aside for groups already.

The two 4-0 seeds and two 4-1 seeds go to the upper bracket knockout, whilst the two 4-2 and two 4-3 seeds go to the lower bracket knockout.

Each match in the upper bracket remains a BO5, but each match in the lower bracket is a BO3.

3 BO5s in the upper bracket (3-5 hours each)
6 BO3s in the lower bracket (2-3 hours each)

1 BO5 for the Worlds Finals 

24-38 hours

Comparing to
7 BO5s in current format

21-35 hours.

Scheduling is also fine if lower bracket teams play twice a week.

Week 1 UB1 UB2 LB1 LB2 LB3 LB4 (14-22 hours instead of 12-20 hours) 

Week 2 UB3 LB5 LB6 (7-11 hours instead of 6-10 hours)

Week 3 Finals


Commentary:
Some people may not be fans of certain teams playing fewer than 6 games in the Swiss Stage, however I think this format withstands that. Do you need an 0-4 team that lost to an 0-1, 0-2 and 0-3 team to show you more? Similarly, the calibre of competition that a 4-0 team will have played to get to that stage are 1-0, 2-0 and 3-0 teams. We aim reduce the “outclassed” stomps and get more hype matchups.

Also oftentimes, you have teams that come 3rd in one group that you see would likely come 2nd in another in this current format, but you never get to see that matchup. In the Swiss-system, we will see such matchups at 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3.

About this knockout stage format, at the cost of 3 more potential hours, Riot has the opportunity to sell 3 more guaranteed hours of content. Still, my Knockouts Week 1 definitely looks a bit grim so I am happy to hear your ideas for how to improve.

I based the changes in the group stage on chess open tournaments, where the aim is to get players to play more equal competition based on performance which naturally leads to hype and close matches.",2021-04-03 20:24:40,1.0,mj7i6f
82q53drx,supersay1an,"Yesterday I queued up for a game and went into champ select. I left champ select with 12 seconds left on the counter cause we lost draft really hard and had an autofilled mid.

56yz5x0f,Eggclipsed,"Since Riot's releasing all these Shadow Isles related champions, here's a concept for a champion I came up with about a year ago. She has the theme of a witch/shaman, Baba Yaga/Slavic mythology style, complete with Black Mist, magic mushrooms, crooked staff, and a hunched back. This is a style we haven't really seen in league so far (unless I'm forgetting someone) and one that I would like to see done. I haven't had many interesting ideas for lore, but I feel like there's a lot of material in the Shadow Isles area of Runeterra.

In terms of gameplay, she's meant to be a control mage with Jungle as her primary role, using Mistshrooms as her primary form of jungle clear and damage, and Black Mist to empower her shrooms and provide some CC. She has a lot of sustained AoE damage (Q), good clear, and pretty good CC, but no mobility and a reliance on Mana to be effective. She is ranged.

To play her well, you'd need to pick the right Mistshrooms for the situation; jungle allows her the time and space to prepare the right Mistshrooms for a successful gank or skirmish. However, that doesn't mean that laning is off the table completely.

**Note: The stats are just there to give an idea of how she would play**, which is why there's no damage numbers. The stats and the champion are **by no means balanced.**

&#x200B;

**Abilities:**

&#x200B;

**Passive: Fungal Bloom**

When Zoraya is in game, different kinds of Mistshrooms will periodically spawn on the map. Mistshrooms are small mushrooms which grow on terrain and can be collected by Zoraya by right clicking and channeling for 0.5 seconds. They have a greater spawn rate when she is nearby. Enemies can kill them with 3 basic attacks. There are five kinds of Mistshrooms: Black, Purple, Red, Blue, and Pale. Pale Mistshrooms cannot be found on the map, rather she has an unlimited supply of them (they are there so that her abilities still function if she runs out of Mistshrooms, so not ideal). Purple shrooms are more common near Baron pit, Red are more common near Red buff, and Blue are more common near Blue buff.

**Note: Like Azir, I think it makes more sense to explain W first, since Q relies on W.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**W: Collect/Sprout (active cd: 1/1/0.9/0.8/0.7secs, cost: 30/28/26/24/22mana)**

Passive: Zoraya can collect up to six Mistshrooms of any kind in her pouch. Upon collecting another, it will go into her inventory, where it can be consumed like an Elixir. This grants her some stats which vary based on her level and which Mistshroom she ingested. (Black: +AP +Magic pen, Purple: +Armor +MR, Red: +AP +Movespeed +Health regen, Blue: +AP +CDR +Mana regen).  Zoraya can only have ingested one Mistshroom at a time, and the stats last for 2mins.

Additionally, Zoraya gains +6% movement speed when walking towards a placed Mistshroom.

Active: Zoraya sprouts her most recently collected Mistshroom at the target location (decent range). If no Mistshrooms are in her pouch, she will place a Pale Mistshroom instead. All Mistshrooms take 0.5secs to sprout, and last 30secs or until killed. They are regarded as units and die in 3 autos as mentioned in the passive. They grant vision in a small radius around them. Enemies that kill a Mistshroom take a small amount of magic damage over 3secs. After placing 3 shrooms within \~4 seconds of each other, Zoraya will not be able to place any for another \~1.5secs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Q: Bursting Spores (Toggle, CD: 0.5secs, cost: \~15/14/13/12/11 mana per second** (this cost might be a little high, just went off Singed at 13/sec))

While off, Zoraya regenerates a small percentage of her missing mana per second. While on, Mistshrooms that have been placed using her W will release spores within a nearby radius (think slightly smaller than Nasus E radius). These spores deal magic damage every 0.5secs to enemies within the radius and have varying extra effects based on the kind of Mistshroom that has been placed:

Pale Mistshrooms: Enemies within the radius are dealt magic damage and are slowed by \~20%.

Black Mistshrooms: Enemies within the radius are dealt magic damage, slowed by \~10%, and have \~5/7.5/10/12.5/15% of their magic resist removed every 0.5secs, up to a cap of 50%.

Purple Mistshrooms: Enemies within the radius are charmed for 1sec, slowed by \~10%, and dealt magic damage every 0.5secs.

Red Mistshrooms: Enemies within the radius are dealt magic damage, slowed by \~20%, and are afflicted with a burn lasting 4secs which deals a portion of the target's max health as true damage over the duration.

Blue Mistshrooms: Enemies within the radius are dealt magic damage every 0.5secs and are slowed by \~40%.

Of these, the Black and the Red Mistshrooms will end up dealing the most damage, whereas Blue and Purple are CC focused options.

Enemies affected by multiple Mistshrooms take slightly reduced damage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**E: Shadow Pool (CD: \~18/17/16/15/14secs, cost: \~100/95/90/85/80mana)**

Zoraya creates a pool of Black Mist at the target location, dealing magic damage to enemies within the radius (range slightly longer than Morg W, radius equal to Morg W). It remains for 2.5secs or until reactivated and grows in radius by roughly +50% over the duration. Damage is dealt upon initial cast and again upon reactivation. If reactivated before 1sec of duration has passed, enemies within the radius are slowed by \~30% for 1sec. If reactivated after 1sec of duration has passed, enemies within the radius are rooted for \~1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9secs.

Mistshrooms within the radius become Engorged for 5secs, gaining increased size, health, and radius and damage on Q.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**R: Mist Wave (Duration: 10secs, CD: \~120/100/80secs, cost: 120mana**

Zoraya uses her staff to launch a wave of Black Mist in a line ahead of her (about the range of a max range xerath q, but the width of a nocturne q) which deals magic damage to all enemies hit. Enemies within a small radius of Zoraya are feared for 1.5sec. This ability can be recast twice over its duration, but enemies cannot be feared more than once.

Mistshrooms within the radius become permanently Engorged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I almost never feed too much, and at the worst im a little behind the enemy. However, I feel like every single game, my teammates seem to be doing terribly. I always thought it was loser’s queue, but there’s no way that I can get loser’s queue this often. I think I’m doing something wrong that is indirectly losing the game, and I think it’s not fighting/splitpushing/farming at the right times.

8wonxuqn,RyujinX9,"so me and my friends were playing a couple of matches for fun and one of them seemingly reminded me of old items from the game and our  conversation went to champs that had better old itemization (in our opinions) so I argued that the old items for kat was so much better especially the gunblade and death dance combo back then (death dance had omnivamp back then if you didnt know) these two items for me are a core for kat builds as they allow for flex items like going semi tank or building the rest ap as death dance gave you some tankiness as well and comparing it to the new itemization for kat which is usually AP vs AD with the start of season 11 kat has developed more into which item path are you going to take usually taking AD when you already have enough ap champs or you need to take ad because of preference or unknown reason i feel like kat's item pathing is a bit inefficient as ap you rush nashors then lich then either protobelt, night harvester, or riftmaker (which is the most beneficial) however i feel like with these builds you have less room to flex or get another situational item because of tank items right now providing strong stats and damage item providing more damage but most of the times less survivability you have to choose whether or not you are going as glass cannon or having more survivability but lesser damage.... I dunno why but i feel like Kat's new item pathing is worse than before

It's true that Lissandra needed buffs, but 10 damage on her Q barely do anything, her Q basically tickles any target, and while the ridiculous sustain that other champions used to have was nerfed, her damage is so small in the early game that enemies can recover from it easily anyway.

Look at Lissandra, she is a short range mage whose only sustain is tied to her Ultimate if she uses it on herself. Her Q needs to be hit through minions to get a decent range, her W is basically melee and her E is slow as hell and is also her movement ability. She needs to take some risk to use those abilities, the least she should have is decent damage, so she can actually be threatening once she goes in. Her late game damage is good, specially because of her passive, but certainly not good enough to justify such an awful early game.

I know there are limits to what can be done to her because her passive is powerful, but since she is unlikely to be in big team fights in the early game, all that her passive does by that point is damage minions and pretend to hit towers (which it should maybe damage, you know, give her some reward for getting kills early with no other enemies around).

8hkkgifk,Creepy_Pilot1200,"Watching LCK just doesn't feel the same anymore, it's just DK vs the World and they're so far ahead of the rest of the LCK that it's no longer entertaining to even follow the regular split because at the end of the day, it will be a 3-0 for DK and no other team is even remotely close.

Remember the old Griffin roster was something like 14-1 in games score vs the core of DK ( with Nuclear ) before they ultimately disbanded in late 2019

I hate what they did to those players and how all that shit went down, ultimately breaking up one of the greatest young core of players that Korea has ever produced. What if Griffin squad had a good org backing them up? What if they upgraded their liability of a toplaner? What if the org didn't commit all those corrupt and shady deeds for personal gain, ruining the brand and potentially careers of said players.

Old rule:
>User posts about the status of servers are allowed, but only if the issue is confirmed by Riot. The post will be removed once the server issues are resolved.

New rule (Still under ""Specific Content Restrictions""):
> [User posts about the status of servers are allowed. However, they must include the following information: The server, the country or region, a description of the issue and screenshots or video as proof. Posts will be removed once the server issues are resolved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/subredditrules#wiki_specific_content_restrictions)

---

This is something many of you requested in the previous feedback threads. In fact, we tried adjusting the rule before. When the game was unplayable for 15 minutes, a confirmation from Riot was no longer necessary. We thought this would solve the issues and did not communicate this change sufficiently, and for that we apologize.

In the [last Feedback Thread](https://redd.it/ll887q) you told us that if you experience a problem with the servers, you come here to see if others have the same issue. You also told us that confusion and false alarms are not a big problem.

We had an internal discussion and we agree! If that is how you use this sub, it is our job to make sure it works as well as possible. For that reason, we have lifted most restrictions on server status posts. Now, similar to our bug reports, we only require you to add some details to the post so other users know what they are dealing with and we can collect information about the problems. This way posts will hopefully be posted quickly and contain enough information so others know what is happening.

We hope this will improve both your experience in this sub and in game! Thanks for your feedback, take care and good luck in ranked!

During a month, +40 high elo streamers will be competing trying to be the highest ranked, but again, starting in Silver. So +40 D1+ players will be smurfing for some days, basically hosted by Riot.

This basically means Riot is promoting smurfing, we can see even pros like Attila playing this. This may be good from a viewer point but what about people that get matched in these games?And also this will make more high elo players smurf, I've already seen some other high elo players who are not competing here saying they'll also play the challenge on their own, with a fresh account (most likely bought in some website).

dn7db,IreliaCarriesuNA,"Hi everyone! Its been a while since my last AMA (which was around when old Irelia got reworked). For any of you that don't know me I used to be known for being a challenger Irelia otp from seasons 3-7. Honestly, I thought I'd be stuck in plat/diamond when the rework was announced, however, I decided to do my best to learn her before thinking such thoughts.

I grinded as hard as I could in the start. Unfortunately, I would always get stuck in the d1-master range so I gave up playing league around mid-season 9. I figured at this point there would be no way I'd hit challenger again with such a mechanical champion (at least compared to the Irelia of old).

I finished college in 2019 and was working two jobs so that tied my hands in terms of hobbies and whatnot. I decided to get back into league/streaming when covid hit because all my work was moved to remote and suddenly I found myself with a lot more free time (commuting was 2 hrs per day for me). I ended up being stuck in grandmaster, despite my best efforts, for most of season 10 and had a very rough February/March in season 11 where I was constantly promoting and demoting to and from master.

I decided to start watching almost every game I played since then and identified a ton of mistakes and started working on fixing them. Obviously my performance skyrocketed since I started doing this.

Let me know if you have any questions! I will do my best to answer all of them.

Unless every single champion we play as is a LeBlanc clone approximating their abilities, to essentially run training simulations for herself to prepare for future eventualities. This way she can have a better idea of what to expect when various factions and people go up against each other (or her), and get experience mimicking important figures.

7nqkf,TerenasIII,"Hello,

I know that this topic has been discussed, debated and spoken about over a thousand times, but I just wanted to put on the field a different idea on how to nerf Chemtank.

There is a TLDR at the bottom for the lazy ones.

At the moment on PBE, the Turbo Chemtank nerf is as follows:

**Turbo Chemtank**

* Supercharged active move speed lowered from 60% to 40%

Which does nerf directly Udyr, Hecarim, and all the Chemtank abusers, since they stack A TON of Flat and % MS Bonus, but indirectly nerfs those tanks that would like to get the Chemtank for the AH Passive AND the active % MS whilst not focusing on stacking as many bonuses as possible, bringing them towards other tank Mythics and excluding them from a situational buy, just because it had to be nerfed for the abusers.

What if instead the Bonus % Movement Speed from Chemtank Turbo was **switched** from**ADDITIVE** % MS Bonus to **MULTIPLICATIVE** % MS Bonus ?

# PREMISES:

For those who are unfamiliar with the nature of % MS Bonuses, there is two kinds, and they're inserted in the Movement Speed Formula as follows:

***Raw Movement Speed = (Base MS + Flat MS bonuses) × (1 + Sum of all Additive Percent MS bonuses) × (1 - Highest Slow ratio) × Product of (1 + any Multiplicative Movement Speed bonus)***

to which you must take into account the rules for the MS Cap as follows (these are the simplified formulas):

* If the raw speed is 415 or lower, no cap is applied.
* If the raw speed is between 415 and 490, final speed is soft capped to RawMS × 0.8 + 83.
* If the raw speed is above 490, final speed is soft capped to RawMS × 0.5 + 230.

# EXAMPLE:

To make an example of ""What's the difference?"" let's calculate Hecarim's movement speed with a 30-35 minutes build and considering lvl 18:

Hecarim + Lucidity Boots + Chemtank Turbo + Deadman's Plate + Force of Nature + Ghost (Summoner) + Celerity (rune) + Nimbus Cloak (rune) + Waterwalking (rune) + Devastating Charge (Hecarim's E)

# LIVE SERVER 11.8 NUMBERS:

Raw Movement Speed =\[345 + 139,1 (Flat bonus MS counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] x \[1 + 148,8% (Sum of Additive % MS counting celerity 7%)\]  x \[1+69,55% Devastating Charge (Multiplicative % MS counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] =

for a grand total of **Raw MS =  2042,1293764 MS**

with the Cap Rules, 2042.1293764 MS becomes

**Effective Movement Speed= 1251,06 Movement Speed**

***Fun to deal with eh?***

with the Nerf Riot is proposing, the number would become as follows:

# RIOT PBE 11.9 NUMBERS:

Raw Movement Speed =\[345 + 139,1 (Flat bonus MS counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] x \[1 + 127,33% (Sum of Additive % MS counting celerity 7%)\]  x \[1+69,55% Devastating Charge (Multiplicative % MS counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] =

for a grand total of **Raw MS =  1865,905430615 MS**

with the Cap Rules, 1865,905430615 MS becomes

**Effective Movement Speed= 1.162,9527153075 Movement Speed**

which is a good nerf to Chemtank Junglers that are very strong at the moment (Volibear, Hecarim, Rammus, Udyr, Skarner in a smaller measure).

At the same time though you nerf indirectly all those tanks that situationally buy Chemtank turbo for the Movement Speed and Slow active, yet will be even **LESS** likely to buy it after this nerf, because it would be straight up garbage for them.

**BUUUUUT**, if you moved the Chemtank Turbo into the **MULTIPLICATIVE** % Movement Speed bonuses, the formula becomes as follows, always considering the Hecarim example.

# PROPOSED CHANGE FROM ADDITIVE % MS TO MULTIPLICATIVE:

Raw Movement Speed =\[345 + 139,1 (Flat bonus MS counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] x \[1 + 84,53% (Sum of Additive % MS counting celerity 7%)\]  x \[1+89,09% (Product of Multiplicative % MS bonuses counting Celerity 7% bonus)\] =

for a grand total of **Raw MS =  1689,159368457 MS**

with the cap rules, 1.689,159368457 MS becomes

**Effective Movement Speed= 1.074,5796842285 Movement Speed or simply 1075 MS**

The nerf would be STRONGER on the affected targets in the following ways:

1. Hecarim/Rammus firstly, due to the fact that Powerball (Rammus Q) and Devastating Charge (Hecarim's E) are ALREADY Multiplicative % Movement Speed Bonuses
2. Udyr, Volibear and Skarner because they have in their own kits % Movement Speed Additive Bonuses

These junglers LOVE stacking many MS bonuses, both Flat and % bonuses, from their kit and their inventory.

With the proposed change/nerf you wouldn't indirectly nerf those tanks that situationally buy Chemtank Turbo, because they usually don't stack many % movement speed bonuses and don't have multiplicative % movement speed bonuses in their kit.

This way you respect the idea that ALL MYTHIC ITEMS should have a fair chance of being bought in their class roster (so for tanks Frostfire Gauntlet, Chemtank Turbo and Sunfire Aegis), whilst stopping the onslaught of Hecarims, Udyrs, Volibears and Rammuses that are working now.

# TLDR:

switching the Bonus % Movement Speed from Chemtank Turbo from being an 

***Additive*** % MS Bonus to a ***Multiplicative*** % MS Bonus would nerf directly the actual meta Junglers, without destroying the chance of other tanks opting into this item situationally.

At first I was really confused why there was classical music constantly playing in the background of my PC audio until I realized it came from the LoL client. It is present even though I had client music disabled for years.

For whatever reason, Riot has started to classify the client music as ""Ambient Sounds"" (even though it's obviously music). In case you didn't know this yet, **you have to [Disable ""Play Ambient Sounds"" in the client](https://i.imgur.com/fkMBMHV.png) in order to mute the new music.**

d2tv0,Usernamehere1235,"Hi everyone. I'm a top main, my repertoire is Fiora, Camille, Irelia, Jax (yes, I'm one of those). I've played Gwen in a few games so far and I've played against her even more, and I've definitely noticed what lots of people have: itemization is problematic. I think AP fighter itemization is bad for a lot of reasons and the fix isn't remotely simple. I'd like to mention what I think are the general problems.

# There simply aren't a lot of AP fighters.

Gwen, Mordekaiser, Sylas are really the priority AP fighters in the space. Other champions like Kennen and Rumble could benefit from AP fighter itemization though (as well as Akali but I'm gonna leave her out since her archetype is clearly assassin).

The reason why this is an issue is because the less champions there are in a specific space, the less consideration they'll get in itemization (Singed, anyone?).

And not only that, but Gwen and Sylas would likely want items that Mordekaiser wouldn't as a juggernaut. AD fighters and juggernauts do share some itemization, but there are some items that are clearly marketed towards one side such as Black Cleaver, Ravenous Hydra, and Blade of the Ruined King.

# AP fighter mythics are poorly designed and feel awkward to build.

I'd like to closely analyze two items to give an example of what I mean.

Trinity Force is the prototype mobile fighter / diver item. Gwen is a champion that would love to have something like Trinity Force; increased stats across the board, super meaningful passives (movement speed on auto attack, sheen procs, AND increased stats per hit), and most importantly powerful components and a reasonable combine cost. Trinity Force costs 3333 gold with a combine cost of 733, and all the components are *very* easy to build as all three of them have components themselves.

What Gwen actually gets is Riftmaker. How does it compare? Well, it does have decent stats across the board, with AP, AH, health, and omnivamp. It also has one decent unique passive that increases overall dmg % and eventually converts that to true damage, but that's about it. It costs a similar amount at 3200 gold. However, its components are **far** less meaningful.

1. Neither component has a meaningful passive even remotely (compare that to Trinity Force where two components have meaningful and useful passives).
2. Leeching Leer just feels bad. 5% omnivamp to me feels almost unnoticeable in lane, and that follows a general trend where omnivamp across itemization doesn't feel like it provides a lot of healing in general to AP fighters, primarily because many of them have lots of AOE.
3. Blasting Wand not having a component item itself makes it awkward to back for. Top laners often back based on the wave state and it can be difficult to back at specific gold timings. This is why traditional fighter items are great as you can usually always pick up at least something. Blasting Wand does not follow this trend.
4. The combine cost is 30% higher than Trinity Force at 1050g (in large part because there's no third component).

I would argue that components matter **a lot** in the top lane, and AP mythics simply have bad components across the board. AD fighter items don't have this same problem as many of the components have meaningful passives as well as reasons to build different components based on how the lane is going or what the matchup is.

# There aren't enough AP fighter items in general.

This time around, I'll examine Mordekaiser. Most will understand that his keystone item is Riftmaker, which makes a lot of sense. He loves the increased damage that stacks with his AOE, and the healing isn't bad either. But after Riftmaker, what does he buy?

Lots of Morde players will build Demon's Embrace, which makes sense. Unfortunately it's nothing but more damage on top of Riftmaker AND has a unique tank busting mechanic, so it's not always the best feeling item to buy.

Some Morde players will pick up a quick Zhonyas, but that's definitely not a fighter item. Generally, juggernauts and fighters alike want health and not specific resistances. This is why fighters have way more access to health than they do to resistances with items like Sterak's Gage, Titanic Hydra, Chempunk Chainsword, Silvermere Dawn, and also every single AD fighter mythic gives at least some HP. It's clear that HP is prioritized for AD fighters, and Zhonyas doesn't fit that trend. I'd also argue that Zhonyas is not a good defensive item for juggernauts in general as it takes away their control. Defensive items on the AD side don't do that (Sterak's Gage and Death's Dance).

Many Morde players will pick up Nashor's Tooth. But clearly that's not right, why would a juggernaut want attack speed? Juggernauts want lots of stats, but attack speed typically isn't one of them, and definitely not as a primary stat on a legendary item.

It's clear that there's an itemization crisis for Mordekaiser. The guy can barely pick up a few items that fits his own archetype, whereas AD juggernauts have lots of decent options. I'm not saying AD juggernauts have perfect itemization or even great itemization, but it's godly compared to what Mordekaiser gets.

This doesn't only apply to Mordekaiser either. Gwen wants attack speed, craves it, would die for it, but all she gets is Nashor's Tooth. There's no other AP attack speed item in the game. And importantly, Nashor's Tooth doesn't improve her tankiness in any way at all. Even Botrk give a significant tank boost to champions like Irelia in the 1v1 because the lifesteal is super meaningful. Nashor's seems like a prank gone wrong compared to Botrk.

&#x200B;

I think these summarize the primary issues with AP fighter itemization. I'll list what I think are the two best solutions.

# Redesign current AP fighter items (mostly Mythics) and introduce new AP fighter legendary items.

This is the most obvious solution. Modelling AP fighter items after AD ones would be a change in the right direction. I'm not saying we need an AP version of every AD fighter item, but deeply examining the reasons why AD fighter itemization works, and trying to fulfill those criteria in AP fighter itemization would almost certainly lead to improvement.

Clearly this solution would take a lot of work and design time from Riot, but I think it would earnestly pay off. AD fighters have benefitted from being designed in a system that has always had at least decent itemization already available to them. AP fighters on the other hand haven't had those keystone items that just always exist that work really well in the class (GREAT examples on the AD side are Trinity Force, the Hydras, and Black Cleaver). I imagine it must be tough to design a champion in a game when the itemization for the class of said champion isn't really fleshed out properly, and I would be surprised if Gwen's designers didn't run into that exact issue.

# Allow AP fighters to use AD items.

There are a few ways to do this. You can change ratios to use AD, or as one redditor suggested recently, you could even make some items use adaptive force stats. I don't personally prefer this solution, because a lot of the fun in playing champions that utilize different stats is in the different itemization. If I was building the same stuff on Gwen as I was on Fiora, it wouldn't feel as fun.

&#x200B;

So yeah that's about it. Thanks for reading if you got this far, post was long but it's about something I care about and I feel I did a good job at explaining what I thought the issue were. Good luck on the rift summoner.",2021-04-18 04:26:27,15.0,msye9r
5or1pjt3,lchuckYOnorris,"There's been a lot of talk about how the jungle meta is so boring with Udyr/Hecarim every game. 

Now obviously its easier to just say that Riot balance team has no idea what they are doing and that pro players will only play what is viable but we know that is not the case.

Phreak makes a comment about how long it took pro players to catch on to the fact that Hecarim/Udyr are strong: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mqpdlp/riot_refusing_to_address_hecarimudyr_meta_for_so/guinoks/

We can even go further back. 

Worlds 2018: https://imgur.com/a/5b8GsSP 

Viktor is highlighted in red. Notice how **it took until the third match of the Quarterfinals until people even considered Viktor an option as a flex pick top/mid**.

Worlds 2017: Everyone blames Riot for the boring Ardent Censer meta. But did you know that **Ardent Censer was even stronger from patch 7.2 and wasn't nerfed until 7.17**, the patch right before worlds.

https://imgur.com/a/d2ZoawD

If you combine the NA, EU, and KR 2017 summer playoffs you will see that **Janna/Lulu were pick/banned a total of 10 times in 60 games** when Ardent Censer was even stronger.

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"Kindlejack just came to the Mundo Discord today to have a small QnA in the Rework discussion, which I also participated in. He's pretty dang excited for the splash art drop.

There isn't too much new information, but I want to keep some things a little up to date regarding information of Mundo's rework.

So here it goes:

* Kindlejack says that Rageborn feels more like a solid 1350 skin, meaning it's more akin to an Epic Skin (Although he doesn't have a unique run animation anymore), and is generally updated with the Riftquest theme in mind, since when Rageborn was released (2012), the Riftquest skinline wasn't much of a thing back then. The most distinct connection of it so far is how his pocket now has a Kindlegem (I think), Refillable Potion, and Pickaxe, which is something most Riftquest skins have with League items being a part of the skins design (With the exception of possibly the new Riftquest skins and a few others).
* El Macho Mundo still keeps the American Wrestler look in it's design, when I asked if the skin will still keep that design considering that it's themed generally around Luchador's. He only responded with, ""Hell yeah brrrrrrrrrotheeeeeerrrrrr!""
* Frozen Prince's VFX's and possibly SFX's are going to be improved to have more oomph to them, since the team heard that it's VFX is generally lame
* The TPA Cup Bonks might be going to be re-recorded
* Like he said before, Kindlejacks favorite skin visually is Mundo Mundo, as it was something he wanted to do for years >!It's implied by some to be a cosplay of Old Mundo!<
* Corporate Mundo is going to be visually designed around the 80's
* When someone asked what Corporate Mundo is going to be like compared to the other Legendaries/Ultimate skins that were reworked, to which Kindlejack responded as:

&#x200B;

"" We are trying something where the base team finish base then take on the legendary right after that. I think it's produced good results. Whether it's truly legendary I think is up to each of you to decide for yourself. ""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kindlejack also made a post where he simply describes that vibes he had for each of the splash arts of Mundo's skins, which are:

3eap81so,KaedesPillow,"Hello,

 I've been trying to learn midlane, but I feel like playing against champions like katarina when I play TF feels so unfair. I literally once use my W and she can dash on me and os me with lvl 5 when i have kindlegem? She ran ignite electrocute so I guess she should deal some damage but to OS me when I have kindlegem feels really unfair. And it doesn't even get better.

Argument for it could be that I'm just shit laner, but like cmon' katarina who literally doesn't have to hit anything, I never complain about getting shit on by someone who hits every skillshot, like for example velkoz/xerath, but katarina, yone, kassadin just out of blue run u down and you just get killed in my case as TF/Orianna.

I just feel like there are too many champions in game that are frustrating, especially those who doesn't have to hit a single ability to kill you, very good examples are Master Yi, Khazix, Garen, Hecarim.

I would say there is at least one of those in every single game I play, doesn't matter on which side and it just sucks to play mages when I can only ban one bad matchup.

Natural counters to these champions are bruisers like renekton, irelia in midlane, but I just want to play mages and have fair shot at beating them , if those assasins outplay me with super sick skilshots and prediciton, I won't be mad, but I am getting oneshot at lvl 5 with kindlegem, because I used my W as TF against kata, I'm sorry

If there are mid mains, how do you feel about viability of mages in soloq? 

I feel like I barely play against any control mages which makes me really sad, because I love the design of them, especially velkoz orianna and TF.",2021-04-18 03:50:40,12.0,msxq5j

I checked his game history, he played Gwen before that and did less damage than enemy's support in that game.

I understand the motivation to learn newly released champions but people should not do this in ranked and cause other people to lose LP as a reault. Play the champion in normals, learn it, get used to it and THEN queue for ranked.

I know Dota has this rule, and I'm pretty sure some other games as well. It's such an obvious solution to avoid conflicts and griefing just because people for some reason want to first time champions in ranked. That's the only reason I always dread new champions, because this happens every time one gets released.

This to you might be ""Oh Veigar or a fed Katarina.""  
Really, I mean the champions who obviously make themselves LOOK like the ""final boss.""  
Cho'Gath, Nasus, Sion, Shyvana, etc.  
These kinds of champions become these sort of bullet sponging super units with the ability to one shot most squishes who show their faces-  


*Most* of these champions.  


As insane as it sounds, the Cho'gath the size of the midlane or a towering Sion with a full mythic passive on Frostfire's counterplay is their whole ""dream"" to be big. The bigger they get, the more they have to soak- the harder it is for them to evade things... the easier it is for them to be killed.  


As dumb as it sounds, why not try experimenting with more size-increasing ""hyper-late"" champions so when they DO become the ""final boss"", not only does the player get the satisfaction of being **the** big bad; but the enemy team has an easier time taking them down?  


If I'm correct, they experimented on PBE with giving Nasus additional range on W depending on stacks. That, considering tenacity only speeds up the slow; would've been awful.  
Something like having Fury of the Sands ""gain +0.1% additional size increase every 50 stacks.""  
Renekton gains ""+0.33% size increase during Dominus for each takedown earned.""  
Shyvana gains ""+5% size increase during Dragon Descent, +5 bonus armor and +5 bonus magic resistance for each Elder Dragon slain.""",2021-04-18 04:38:08,4.0,msym3f

No accompaniment/left hand because I'm too lazy and untalented for that. Slurs and stuff are just how I think I should be playing this piece on my flute so feel free to phrase it how you would.

77zwdxvs,Eunnai,"To explain for those that don't know. If you are in a bush and the enemy doesn't have a ward in it then it becomes easy to hit enemies with your combo. For example, Taliyah's W can be easily dodged if you see the animation for it and you hear a sound when it's cast. But if she is in fog of war you don't see any animation or hear it until it hits you. So you can get a bunch of free kills by waiting in bushes.

So if you want to abuse stuff like this then you can pretty much camp most bushes as jungler. Stuff like the bush in between T1 and T2 towers are good so you can 1 shot enemies before they can even come back to lane

Another one is during dragon resets if you base 1 minute before and camp the river bush you can just clear vision and get a free kill on the first person that walks up to get dragon control.

A lot of champs can do this stuff like Elise, Nidalee, Gragas are a few other examples of champs that can do this.

7uw5r,DaRaven,"I have just gotten into the game lately and I am having a lot of fun with it, but I still feel it is a bit difficult to know how I should be playing each champion with there being so many. Is there a post or place that breaks down each champion into a small 2-3 sentence overview of what the role is they play in the game that makes them unique? I would love to be able to quickly look at a small guide before each game to know generally what I am up against. During the loading screen I usually try to pull up general skills on my phone, but it is hard to do in a small amount of time. 

E.G. 
Pantheon - Able to play top lane, but also fits in a number of other roles. In early stages pull of quick kills on the enemy while late game use his global ult to move around the map and create presence.

1. Literally using skills
2.orientation
3. Leveling up
4.build, how to use them? Are there any presets for these builds?

he's doing much much better in the top lane now but his performance mid also improved (where he was already very strong) when the goal of the changes was to nerf him mid and buff him top.

I think that if they want to make him better at dealing with tanky opponents like he is now he should probably lose some of his ability to nuke squishies down as quickly as he does. From my experience playing him he can melt just about anyone in a very short time once he gets rolling and I don't feel like he should be able to do it so quickly. 

I do like the changes overall; Overheating actually feels like something to think about doing with a reasonable reward for using it right rather than something you want to avoid altogether in PVP. His kit flows a lot better now, in my opinion, and I already liked playing him before the changes, but he definitely needs to be iterated on a little more.

3hqcybz5,LotusOrder,"Hi guys, this is my first post (and probably my last) but i needed to vent out to someone about this, so I'm a midlaner since Season 7, I've been playing normals for most of life until i learned that I'm actually decent and that i can play ranked, every season I'd just play placements to see where I'd land and i get to bronze and just don't care to grind any further, starting last season i tried to actually play ranked for real, i climbed from I4 (yes i landed there for some reason) to S4 but season ended when i was B1 as i started the grind around 1 month before the season ended, so it doesn't count as silver, this season i was determined to hit gold and i finally climbed up until i got to S1 playing around 6 games a week, then i got bombarded with smurfs, every other game i would get an enemy midlaner with a level 30 account that would usualy pick something like Kassadin or Vladimir or Katarina, and i would try to CS and play safe knowing that they are smurfs even sometimes win early trades and push them out of the lane, but game goes on and they get fed off me or botlane and we get obliterated to oblivion, just played a game 2 hours ago where the enemy toplaner was in gold mmr at level 37 and picked Kennen, he got fed off my top and jungle and just kept on deleting us in every teamfight moving forward, the next game it was a level 41 midlane Kassadin who did just the same and deleted us at 15 minutes, this honestly destroyed my mental, like I'm completely sure that it's not easy for riot to identify if someone is smurfing or just playing well, and a suspension in this case would most of the time be invalid, but why am i supposed to deal with this? Why am i losing my hard earned lp in this awful way? My gaming experience is highly impacted, I'm losing my passion for the game, and it's generally affecting my mood thus affecting how i deal with people around me just because of a bad game where it's just another smurf smashing our nexus at 14 minutes,  I'm ok with losing lp when it's my fault that i lost, but it's very upsetting whenever you look at enemy team's levels and it's just another level 30ish account playing in your mmr and you're sure he's just gonna end the game before you buy boots, I can't think of something to eliminate this issue, but god this game would've been perfect if i can just play with people around my skill level even slighly higher, not some dude who's trying to have fun off giving me a hard time in ranked...i started to hate ranked and the game in general but I'm still hoping I'd overcome this and get to gold, but I'm losing the fun aspect, just aiming for the feeling of accomplishment...which is not what the game should only be about.

TLDR ranting about how smurfs are destroying my (and every lower elo's) gaming experience.",2021-04-18 07:37:49,0.0,mt1qzn

Imo, when we enter the practise range we should be able to pick any champ we want, to see their mechanics better and everything before possibly picking them up. This way you don't have to wait for the weekly champ rotations to test out mechanics, but you'd be able to try out champs and see which one you think suits you more. really what's the point of the range only granting you access to champions you own .d",2021-04-16 21:09:10,558.0,ms2s9p

9wupred0,OhNoItsTheGrimReaper,"There is an issue with the lp system being too harsh to players who aren't smurfing (the new smurf queue is a whole separate topic). Players near their actual skill level but slightly below are no longer able to climb. The plus 7 to 11 lp for a win and minus 19 to 21 lp for a loss thing is a very real problem and riot seriously needs to address it. No matter what elo you're in that's not an ok system. 2 wins at 11 lp is +22 and 1 loss at -19 lp nets a player +3 lp. At a 66% win rate and +3 lp every 3 games, that would take 400 games to gain 400 lp (one full tier). No iron player with bronze level skill or bronze player with silver level skill, etc should have to play 400 games to only climb a single tier and they would have to hold a 66% win rate to do so. Not all of us can play league day in and day out to hit 400-800 games per season. 

I get that as you climb your mmr goes up as well but it never actually catches up to where you are so you never get back to that +14/-15 sweet spot that I think (or hope rather) that riot intended.

It seems logical to me that someone should be able to climb very very gradually with a 51% win rate, in this case the 400 games for a tier example from before would make sense. But here's the issue with the current season. In the previous example of +11/-19, at a 60% win rate that would be 11 + 11 + 11 - 19 - 19 = -5 lp. With the current system some one will go DOWN 5 lp every 5 games for WINNING at a 60% win rate which is actually a pretty good win rate! 

This has been happening to me personally this season with a 53% win rate in ranked for this season after over 250 games played (I know, not great but still not bad enough that I should be losing lp) and it has also happened to many of my friends and players I've talked to online. I know people from iron to gold who are experiencing this problem and many have positive win rates. The new lp system changes this season have not benefited anyone.

How do I get Riot to see this? I get the desire to make the game more challenging for the diamond to challenger players out there. I get that after winning 20+ games in a row a players mmr will eventually go up enough that they get more than +11 but the game is actually unfun for most with a system this punishing. After 100 games at a 60% win rate to be at or below where someone was when they started the ""grind"" is not a fun experience for anyone. @Riot, please fix the LP/MMR system!! #makelolgreatagain",2021-04-18 07:08:48,0.0,mt19b0

5i70ng4m,ScuffedLynel,"Really just the title. I've had a lot of games go about 20 minutes (which is normally around when everyone hits level 18) and the game kind of stalls for a bit because everyone is full build and max level. Not to mention death timers are relatively short, meaning if you win a battle on your end of the bridge, you'll likely have to fight another before you can end the game (though this isn't always the case).

I couldn't really find a good source that shows the average ARAM games, but I feel like any that surpass 20-25 minutes is going on too long for a game mode that's meant to be fast-paced when compared to modes like URF or Nexus Blitz that usually don't last longer than 20 minutes. 

As such, I think a good thing to make ARAM games faster is to remove the level cap like in URF. I don't see any harm in implementing this but let me know what you think.",2021-04-18 06:46:13,0.0,mt0vjf

Now however, I can’t seem to get rid of the autolock. I have the settings on “Semi-locked” but it still doesn’t allow me to see the entire map if i want to. The other ones (fixed offset & per side offset) are even worse than this. The camera won’t unlock when I press Y either. It also wont center on the champion when pressing space even tho I got that set on settings. The only way I’m able to see other lanes is that if I click on them on minimap. Oh and when I click on that little camera button next to minimap it won’t do anything, it still stays locked. I did some research and google said I should click somewhere on the minimap and move around a bit, that DID work and it did unlock the map but only until I pressed space, then it flew to my champion and locked the camera again. I had to make a new account so this is fine for now but long term its definitely gonna become a problem. How am I supposed to quickly check other lanes and stuff? Any help would be appreciated!

s5hltwf,npri0r,"**Why I made this**

So for a while I've wanted there to be a viable team that was composed entirely of aspects. Unfortunately, there is no aspect that is a marksman. Seeing as hunters and marksmen go pretty well together, and aspect of the hunt would work perfectly. I designed this champ (Caelus) to function as a adc and possibly jungler as a secondary position. He is meant to synergies well with leona and taric. I designed him so that pre 6 he can help his supports lock down targets, then shred them with his ramping missing health damage. Then post 6 is when he can really 1v1 people, being able to use his entire kit without having a support to land crowd control for him all the time and instead using his ult (though his ult wont be up for every fight). Caelus will be a bit of a snowbally champ, requiring an early lead to stay ahead. Because he has missing health damage, he will require a lot of damage to make sure he can consistently  get enemies low enough to finish off.  So, a champ like leona would be perfect alongside him. Unusually for an adc, Caelus will by default be melee. He fights with a spear, but his e passive allow him to be ranged at the cost of mana.

EDIT: yes most of the abilities are heavily inspired by other champs. Turns out unique abilities are really hard to design. I made these abilities to show what this champ could be, rather than what he should. Any ideas for uniqueness would be cool tho.

**Champ bio** [https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofruneterra/comments/msz76k/caelus\_aspect\_of\_the\_hunter\_champ\_idea\_biography/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofruneterra/comments/msz76k/caelus_aspect_of_the_hunter_champ_idea_biography/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**The abilities**

*Passive: fated to die –* Caelus gains bonus on-hit damage and attack range when attacking enemies on low health. If Caelus kills an enemy (champion or creep) he will regenerate a small percentage of his maximum mana. Hitting an enemy champion stacks ‘fated to die’ on them. At 5 stacks Caelus’ attacks deal damage based on their missing health.

*Q: Hunter’s spear –* Caelus holds up his spear and channels briefly. At the end of the channel he hurls the spear in the target direction. The spear damages all enemies hit, slows them, and marks all champions for a short duration. If a champion is rooted or stunned while the mark is active, the duration of said crowd control is increased and the mark is removed on all enemies. If this ability is cast while in a brush, or invisible, the spear’s range is increased.

*W: Celestial pursuit –* Caelus dashes in a target direction, and gains a large amount of attack speed for a small duration and a small amount of movespeed towards enemies that are movement impaired.

*E: Starforged bow –* Caelus summons his bow and shoots a burst of arrows in a narrow cone. The arrows disappear on damaging an enemy. This ability deals increased damage to jungle monsters.

*E: passive* – Caelus gains the ability to summon his bow. When attacking enemies in melee range, he will use his spear. Upon attacking enemies outside of this range, he will expend a small amount of mana and use his bow instead. Bow attacks deal slightly more damage than spear attacks, and gain significantly increased range over the spear from fated to die

*R: Comet shot –* Caelus charges his bow briefly, then fires an arrow wreathed in starfire in a direction. Upon hitting a champion or epic monster, they will be rooted for a duration, and take damage proportional to their maximum health.",2021-04-18 05:09:35,1.0,msz6y7
scu39mb,skull11244,"Going to start with looking at Gwen, the newest attempt at an AP bruiser. This part is short.

Right now, Gwen feels weak. Her kit is fine, but she feel unpowered. Yes I know she is on day 1, but compared to the 200 and 201 years of Aphelios and Samira, she feels really weak.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure the biggest problem with her is more of a item problem. It is no secret that AP bruiser items are slightly less powerful they should be. (Being nice here)

The problem with these items is that as soon as they become viable on AP bruisers, Akali and Katarina show up and abuse the living hell out of them. For whatever reason, Riot refuses to rework/retune whatever makes these champions good with them (I don't know what that is, Katarina having too many blinks, Akali having shroud?) Until this is fixed, AP bruisers, ***CANNOT*** have good itemization. Regardless of how you personally feel about this, it means that AP bruisers either have to go full tank (Cho'gath), full AP (Sylas, Diana) or suffer with bad items (Mordekaiser). My **opinion** is that AP bruisers are good for the game, and should have items to support them (I believe Riot themselves said one of the goals of the item rework was to give them better itemization. GJ) No matter the way that this takes, be it targeted nerfs at abusers (Riot has a */s great /s* track record with targeted nerfs like that, just look at the current Chemtank abusers!) or some items that they cannot abuse, whatever those may be, I personally believe that something needs to be done for these champions. If Riot wants to keep releasing this class of champion, then something needs to be done. This would also revive certain playstyles and even champions that haven't seen the light of play in months, if not longer. While it would be a massive undertaking, having to rebalance not only the abusers, but also champions like Cho'gath who are currently doing fine and would only benefit from better item choices, it is important for them to do so, if only to fulfill their promise to do so.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Champions that abuse AP bruiser items ruin the class as a whole.",2021-04-17 06:38:01,64.0,mseavn
4p7lra,Number4extraDip,"TL:DR at end

He seems like a decent control top laner.

It's more of tower defence/freeze kind of deal as you farm grasp. 

With harass you're usually able to keep enemies in check from going in on you. Either by being close to own tower, or being able to keep enemies at 60-50% hp consistently through harass.

Keep this up long enough and they all in out of frustration and die.

You also always have a setup for a gank cause of this.

My core is titanic + deaths dance.

Mythic options: goredrinker/stridebreaker/all the funfire suncapes.

Best items to finish up: demonic embrace (the tank stats alone are great value and ap for kit boost)

Into ap- abyssal mask
Into ad- frozen hearr.

Options for grievous wounds: replace demonic with thornmail, or chempunk chainsword if snowballing.

Getting grievous wounds moves demonic further, but it is an amazing tank item so that's the trade-off.

Had struggles vs:

-Grasp adc's

-Mordekaiser (his kit counters what you do. He wants to be on top of you, and will always try to pull you out of comfort zone)

People have issues vs Darius for same reason, but i find darius easier to manage as he eventually runs out of mana, doesn't have a burn field and almost always q's after subjugate, so its ez to stay in safe q centre then waddle out.

-Urgot: dude half healths you just from flipping you at lvl 3. With his flip cd, its hard to be harrassing him cause 1 flip enables him to unload whole kit into you.

-GP

Runes: 

You are looking to sustain yourself as long as possible while holding enemy in a bad spot.

Theres lots of champs with potential to kill you, so you need to make that as hard as possible.

-Grasp

-Demolish ( you need lane pressure for when you kill laner, otherwise you might even lose tower first in a hard machup)

-second wind

-the hp growth from minions one

I find it significantly better vs heal/shield boost cause more free hp is not only good, it's also good for titanic (the damage of titanic+e is dummy thicc dd just makes the SLAP even harder)

Secondary runes are matchup dependant.

Triumph/last stand or eyeball+movespeed or omnivamp

2

1

1

Summoners are self explanatory: flash and tp/ignite

Note: i take ignite more often than not. It helps you win losing fights and makes you more of a threat when you are defending safely.

TL:DR

He feels pretty decent in top lane and feels like he can catch many people off guard and just make laning frustrating to them with the way Thresh likes to lane (freeze under tower + bondage)

He has his good and bad matchups like most toplaners do.

Has a huge learning curve, but if you played Thresh enough in supp role, you should already have a good idea of what Thresh limits are vs other champs, and you had your fair share of 1v2 botlanes by now. So you have a decent shot at pulling it off.

The last 3 years of my life I have been playing enough League of Legends to forget about my problems (like having a mother so toxic that she wishes her own son to die, spits on him and talks shit about him among other things). I have successfully graduated from Baccalaureate and I want to start university next year, because this year I have not been able to go (I failed the entrance exams). I have always had problems with my mother since I was a child but now more than ever.

This last year has been partly great because I have fixed my social life, now I go out about 3-4 times a week (almost always complying with the restrictions, I am not going to deceive you, I have not always complied with them) with my friends, I am doing sports and getting stronger with visible changes (which I will soon post on reddit as well), I think it has been the happiest year of my life, it has been incredible. But at home it has been the opposite, each time it has gotten worse, my mother every day entering my room asking me why I am not working with a threatening tone, treating me as if I were a loser (as if it were easy to find a job in a country with a youth unemployment rate of 40%, that is, 4 out of 10 young people are not working and the rest have garbage contracts), until I found a job as a telemarketer, it was tremendous garbage, my job consisted of calling older people offering them changes of electric and gas company, cheating them with the rates, we had to make the recordings of the calls with the clients, but we had to modify them so that everything sounded legal, they fired me a week later.

&#x200B;

I used to go to the library to study for the university entrance exams every day so as not to see them in the morning, because if my mother found out that she had thrown me out, she would be throwing it in my face every day. It is enough for me that whenever she sees me she says that I am a great disappointment. On top of that, the idiot of her boyfriend spoils everything even more, always talking badly about me and telling her that he wants me to leave home, to the point of threatening me repeatedly. My grandmother who comes to visit us on Sundays (she works as an intern taking care of an elderly lady) is aware of the situation and has been telling me for months to try to make living together easier, but the truth is that it has not helped at all. She doesn't live with us for basically the same reason, my mother has been denigrating her with her boyfriend for a long time and she decided to leave.

I don't know what to do, finding a job is making it impossible for me, they have threatened me several times to throw me out of the house, I have mentioned these problems to my friends but they do not understand the seriousness of the situation and if the worst happens, I do not believe that nobody can help me.

I have been offered a job by a temp agency in the Netherlands, and I have spoken with people who have gone there to work and have not really had such bad experiences, but between the flight, and the covid tests that have to be done and with the shit of salary, they were left without any money when they returned to Spain. Another problem, if I go to Holland, when I return to Spain where will I go?

&#x200B;

I cannot enlist in the army because I do not have the nationality of the country in which I reside, and my country of origin (Ukraine) is at war. Holy shit i don't want to go there to die.

Yeah, she was made just to be a more accessible champ for Lux and Sona players and not much else, especially since they feel like there was no popstar archetype in League for champions.

They were going to release her around halfway in 2020, but chose to do it around K/DA when it was conceptualized for said year due to the strong themes around her and the skinline.

Meaning they already locked on her kit and art, hence why she was teased around Twitter early I believe.

I can't find the Reddit comment itself, but I found the twitter link that has it:

So yeah, she wasn't made just because it popped out of think air around K/DA, it just sounded convenient to release around that event.

1b3khpk1,_Rootbeard_,"To everyone in gold and surely below, listen up!

Around the 3 minute mark there is a tense period where players should be expecting the map to show some dynamic and often times bizarre events depending on matchup. From a potential early gank that skips crab, both junglers contesting the same crab,  or maybe junglers taking their own crab with the still persisting tension it might be stolen and that rengar might be lurking in river brush waiting for that moment, you want to pay attention.

In this specific case I bring up, it's a Rengar top looking to do the stealing. He has lane prio and let a building wave push under Irelia's tower. He knows the Lillia should be low and pathing to the topside scuttle. Just as his Volibear begins moving to botside scuttle, Rengar spots Lillia at 1/3HP at the one topside. She backs off and Rengar is pleased with his guesswork and decision making. Pinging his mid, who has also gotten his lane pushed, to come help or just for general awareness, Rengar thinks this is in the bag and starts taking scuttle. But the Irelia has given up a small portion of the big wave to move towards her distressed jungler and Rengar's mid has not moved still. Pinging to no avail, the scuttle is secured by Lillia as Rengar backs off from the hopeless 2v1 situation he had no control over. Having lost the exp adv with the wasted time at scuttle and being forced through blue jungle to get back to lane, he's furious. He knows this is big in deciding the matchup and he does lose his lane because of this.

His jungler, JUNGLER of all people starts flaming him for feeding after his first death and the mid laner agrees. The Rengar is an avid jungle player who sees no hope left in humanity after this and contemplates quitting league entirely.

mlcv1b,Baemon_qq,"Disclaimer: didn‘t include Karsa, SofM and FoFo since I have no idea of politics

I chose the top4 players in every role from china and korea based on my opinion. Then I use those 4 to compare each role and decide which country I think  has the stronger top players.


Support

Chinese: Ming, Meiko, Missing, Crisp

Korean: Keria, CoreJJ, Beryl, Lehends

While Keria is world class I think China dominates this matchup really easily with all 4 supports being insane laners, shotcallers and clutch players. I think Keria and CoreJJ share those attributes but aren‘t quite on the same level. Beryl is too hit and miss and his laning isn‘t that great and Lehends is sometimes insane when he pops off with his special tech but sometimes invisible. 

China gets the point

Top

Chinese: Xiaohu, Flandre, Zoom, 369

Korean: Nuguri, Khan, Kiin, Rascal

When making this I thougt Korea wins the toplane matchup easily but with Xiaohu appearing to be maybe the best top in LPL (we‘ll see tomorrow) this gets quite close. In my opionion every other top is a tier below xiaohu and nuguri at the moment since they all lack something. Be it laning, carry potential, clutch factor or consistency. Yet, I think Khan saves the point for Korea even though it‘s super close.

Korea gets the point

Mid

Chinese: Knight, Cryin, Angel, Yagao

Korean: Chovy, Showmaker, DoinB, Scout

This is quite a no brainer in my opinion. DoinB and Scout are the best mids in LPL together with Knight who isn‘t the gigasmurf anymore this split and FoFo who isn‘t even in this list. Chovy is the best laner while Showmaker is really good at basically everything else lol. Cryin, Angel and Yagao are clearly a tier below them.

Korea gets the point

Adc

Chinese: JackeyLove, Lwx, GALA, Jiumeng

Korean: Viper, Ruler, Ghost, Teddy

This is quite interesting. Viper is probably the best adc in the world at the moment and Ruler is, well Ruler. I find it quite hard to rate Ghost but I admit he‘s pretty good and Teddy I think is the worst out of the 8 adc. The 4 chinese adc are all very different JKL being a god at times and just inting at other times. GALA playing in a team that plays around top mainly which is pretty unique. Lwx being the opposite with FPX ganking bot every 30 seconds and Jiumeng having to do the heavy lifting for his team most of the time. After some consideration I would actually rate this as a tie because Ruler lacks clutch factor in my opinion and while viper is playing insane part of it is because his team gives him the opportunity to do so. The chinese adc are super consistent (except JKL) and know exactly how they wanna play their games.

Both get a point



Jungle

Chinese:JieJie, Wei, Tian, Beishang

Korean: Canyon, Clid, Kanavi, Pyosik

This would be a point for China if it wasn‘t for Canyon, the best player in the world atm. The jungle meta at the moment is quite boring. It‘s mostly full clearing tanks who rush Chemtank and then run down the squishies. So Junglers can‘t really show how good they really are right now. So I would rate everyone except Canyon quite similarly with a tendency towards China because of the early creativity of JieJie, Beishang and Wei. But Canyon carries his fellow countrymen.

Korea gets the point


In the end it is 4:2 for Korea.

Quite a surprising result since I think LPL is overall the strongest league having the most teams.
But at top of the top of the top Korea still has some of the best individual players. Maybe that‘s gonna change in the future. I guess we‘ll have to see.",2021-04-18 03:18:00,1.0,msx3ua
8otucsdb,Cryopyte,"Hi!

&#x200B;

I decided to pickup league in early 2020 but i quit after a while since i really didn't understand the game. But in 2021 i thought that of playing it again and i gotta say im getting addicted to it. The problem is that i really dont understand the game or have the game knowledge. I know the basics like attacking/moving/nexus/baron,dragons, etc but thats really it. I have watched couple of yt tutorials but i think everybody knows how ''great'' they are. I don't know where to start or what do to next or how to get better. I really wanna understand the game fully,champs,laning etc. Any tips? good tutorials? 

So my question is how could i finally understand/learn league?

However I checked today and I got demoted all the way to D4, like if I didn't play 10 days ago. Is this normal? Do I have to win the game for it to reset?

8nmhlrv5,HansCarriage,"The Hextech system was introduced back in 2016 (feels like an entire life ago if you ask me) and since then I've received these skins through it, for a total of 77105 RP. This doesn't consider the MANY skins I rerolled and just gave away, which means the numbers could get higher. I also have to say that I've actually never used lots of these and that I even forgot to own some of them in all these years. Still, they're approximately worth €622. 

https://preview.redd.it/z4n5c8h6tit61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e4022eb68f3835a171a3102b8471400b008016

Just to be clear about this: the price of 1 RP is not really that. I got that number from the fact that to buy 310 RP you need €2,50. To buy 650 RP you need €5,00, which means the value of 1 RP gets lower. So, we have to say that this is just an estimate (and not really that accurate).

Lastly: I have not played costantly the game since 2016. I rarelly played in 2017 and 2018, it was actually FNC run in 2018 Worlds that got me back to the game. Most of these are as a matter of fact acquired between 2018 and 2021. I think I can say to have played an average of 2 games a day in the last two/three years. Which means these numbers could change A LOT for everyone!

I was planning to re-install League of Legends, but I haven't been able to do it for a few days now as this message keeps popping up all the time. Do you know any solutions? In the message it says: SERVER UPDATE NOT AVAILABLE

""Um it looks like our servers are down at the moment and we couldn't get the update needed to start the game. We're sorry, and we're trying to fix this as soon as possible. Please try again later.",2021-04-18 01:33:42,1.0,msv3uw
2p5s02vb,jsmamhruskastoglavo,"Does anyone else really miss old PvP gamemodes? Yeah, same here.

Sometimes I randomly remeber good old gamemodes like fighting the big Xerath in Ascension and being juggernaut, the slightly less older Project one, or the blood moon one where you could only play a selected pool of champs.

I believe with a little bit of updating and work some of them have great potential of being actually played.

Co-op were also great, but if I recall correctly Riot said they aren’t bringing them back, so that’s a bit of a shame.

My personal favourite was definitely the dark star one, where you had to pull enemis into a black hole in the middle of the map. 

TLDR; There were some amazing gamemodes in the past and I think they would do great nowadays with some updates.",2021-04-18 01:29:11,1.0,msv0s5
uc9zq,Xenton,"In the original teasers for her abilities, the impression was made that Gwen's passive was based on her own HP.

This was later corrected, but many still believed it to be own HP and a lot of players were excited to ""Finally"" have an AP bruiser champ that gets to build defensive items.

Instead, we got another on-hit based champ with extremely limited build choices who is shoehorned into being a Jack-of-No-Trades who's somehow mediocre at everything she does and also frustratingly niche.

A percent own HP passive would have allowed so many more build paths:

* Stack AP and go for ability damage with the passive being nothing but a slight perk if you grab AP+Health items.

* Stack AS/On-hit in a modified version of her current build, but with a few more item choices.

* Stack pure AS and health items and go for a bruiser build.

* Stack health and defences and play like old tahm, but without the insane CC potential.

Instead, her build is bland and weak and shatters her early game potential without actually giving her a good late-game.

Moreover, if it turns out she's strong once people are used to playing her, that doesn't make the build path any better, it just means the ""Feast or famine"" Ap stack will be that much more frustrating to play against.",2021-04-18 01:13:15,0.0,msuq1w
nk80q,nagasadhu,"So I queued up in 1st ranked game on my original account, and I lost the game, because my ADC started running down mid. And I was placed Bronze 4. Even though I scored B+. So now even if I win all the rest of my games (which is pretty much impossible) there is no way I can end up in even Silver in my promos.

Last season when I played promos, I had lost my first game, and I was placed Bronze 2. By the end of promos I was Silver.

Is there any logic behind the first placement match?? Or is it just RNG again and you're basically screwed if you get a bad team?",2021-04-18 04:53:56,0.0,msywj0

i am in a weiir Sittuattion. I played in a Team on Diamond Level and i was playing toplane.  
The Team didnt improve a lot so i left tthe Team in order to focus on my own skill and performance.  
I liked the duel type playstyle of toplane, but im not a huge fan of tanks. Because my best friend plays midlane i switch over to adc and immideatly had a huge success. I like playing Champs like Xayah, Jinx or Caitlyn. But i somehow feel i dont have a big say over who ultimately wins the game. So i feel kind of pointless sometimes. I think Midlane is a lane that would suit my playstyle but i also want to play with my friend. Do you guys have any advice on what i should do or change?

why did they feel the need to change such a nice active item that has been used by so many champs for seasons long. It felt core on a lot of champs but not necessary, it was just rly nice to get the extra clear, animation cancels etc.

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"Because sometimes being viable or even the greatest isn't always the determining factor depending on what they have in their kit that drives general players away from the champ.

So while viability can affect popularity, most people pick champs based also around the general fell one has when playing a champion.

Ezreal is not really considered a meta or even maybe a decent pick, but he's still picked greatly simply due to how his kit generally works.

In the case of Gwen...

* She seems to be very Ult reliant in general, and thus needs to have their Ult in mind every time they would fight generally. Many people usually don't like that unless they have other things they can do such as Malphites damage, or Fiddles Q/W. Kennen is a big example of this.
* She only seems to counter tanks and not much else, making her more of a counterpick than a blind pick
* She has no sticking power for a class that focuses on sticking to enemies in 1v1 due to them being duelists
* The only Skirmisher in League where her main damage ability Self-Stuns, while also having no greater upside for said self-stun, since while Yasuo and Yone's Q self stuns, they are not only still faster in comparison, but they also have a Q follow-up that leads into big trades, while Viego's synergizes his Q well with his dash stun, something that Gwen doesn't have as much of despite of the true damage and the dash (Which isn't nearly as much distance as other dashes around her class like Tryndamere or Fiora).
* She's one of those characters who is supposed to suck in the Top Lane early while also being greater later on...... In a Lane that is not only considered an island, meaning she can't used her hypercarriness as well aside from splitpushing, but most of the other Top Laners outstat her, in a game where the early game is becoming something very important to take advantage of.
* She also doesn't even have a decent tool to get around her early game due to the lack of range from her Q, which also self-stuns her. Unlike someone like Kayle who at least has E, or Nasus who gains HP from minions, along with W and E.

**Remember, this is more about guessing on the champion herself, rather than thinking it would be absolute in what she would be based on first pieces of data that only appeared at around a few days since her release.**

1ojuvlmh,therealrizin,"Hello there,

&#x200B;

as mentioned in thread I am kind of pretty good player from 7/8 years ago which played LoL once again. Tbh game changed so much and would like to share my opinion about it:

1. (good) Players are way better :) I would say gold is old high plat level and plat is old diamond. What  they are missing the most is just map awarness and decisionmaking!
2. (bad) You are getting forced to play supper agressive. There is no ""better safe than sorry"" option anymore. If you lose on lane you will most likely lost the game in soloQ. As one of the most safe-playing players I became lvl 3 turret diver. More about it in next points
3. (bad) Roaming when loosing lane is no longer an option. Turret gives way too much gold. You are forced to win your lane to roam since loosing both minions, turret gold and risking fail on gank is way too much. Currently 2 turret ticks are worth more than a kill... So now roaming can cost 1250g+minions instead of 150g+minions.
4. (bad) Dragons currently matter too much. Back in my time it was worth 125g (not sure) and was possible to get this advantage back. Right now in worst scenario enemy gets 4 drakes with 3 infernals in it and you are literally done. Coming back becomes almost impossible.
5. (bad) According to these top lane looses it matter even more (saying it as mid main) and playing this place is kind of masochism. There are heralds to pay back a little but it is not worth the dragons. Also the lane lenght and being solo makes it the worst place to carry games.
6. (bad) New legendary items are terrible giving all in one without even planning the build. Example:Yasuo before: thinking between static to build as/ms/crit or build some dmg. Also worth thinking about lifesteal  
Now: Lifesteal, dmg, crit and automatic shield in case of dangerous situation! And this all in one item!  
Also I feel like tanks are pretty left behind with it and it is terrible for them to do anything right now (tho I am not tank player, just nuking these around and it looks too easy)
7. (bad) New champions are just a joke. Their abilities are just crazy where 1 ability can have power of 3 and passive feels like 5th skill. Watching one of spotligh I found comment which I'd like to add here:""Back in my times champion in LoL was just some fat man walking with barell""Right now I don't even feel like these new champs are any way planned to cooperate with balance level of the game.
8. (bad) Still no voice chat in game...
9. (bad) Too many champions coming out. As old player had problem getting used to these so how about new casual players?
10. (good) Better possibilities to get champions for begginers",2021-04-17 06:46:33,20.0,msegpo

If the enemy team is heavy magic damage, you either can’t buy mana or you have to invest into an item which is only useful against 1 or 2 champions on their team.

Hi, I'm a new league player that recently started ranked! I did play alot of normal before playing ranked. In my normal games I mostly win lane and hard carry I only lose if my team fed. But in ranked I either go even and hope that my team carry me or I either just feed in lane. I never went something like 15/3/4 like i do in my normal games I'm mostly 2/4/6 or 1/9/4. I play the same I'm not like scared of losing but I still do way worst in ranked than normals.

I got placed in Bronze III and got promoted to Bronze II. I'm a Shen OTP with only 52k points and I'm level 6. I play Shen only in top since I don't really get my secondary role or autofilled.

I don't really know how to improve. Should I play shen in another role or keep playing normals or learn it the hard way and play in ranked (with /mute all on ofc) and risk getting demoted (if you can because I dont really now how the ranked system works)

Many streamers I watch in various Elo's take the krugs, but I don't feel like it's worth sacrificing 10 seconds after the crab spawn to take those since it might go to the other jungler and you'll have to run across the whole map doing absolutely nothing but running to get the crab on the other side.

If bot lane dies, the jungler cannot 2v4 and take drake. If the mid laner dies, the jungler cannot take drake in a 3v4, without risking death to smite.

I have been playing top lane and jungle for the many years I have played league. I peaked Plat 1, and it blows my mind that in this elo, people do not understand the concept of a timer, and how a timer works. 

If dragon is spawning within 30seconds-1 minute, DO NOT have a full on fight bot lane, without the confidence your team will guarantee the win. 

People should be forced to jungle to understand why we have all these funny cute little count down timers, and what they do.",2021-04-15 23:46:07,4618.0,mrhf3j

46m306sj,starhockey36,"Hello all,

I recently entered a league organized by some peers which consists of 6 teams. The top 6 players in the league were assigned “captain” role and drafted the remaining players on their team. Each team will play the other teams one time in a Bo2 before playoffs. 

There are 3 diamond players and 3 low silver / high bronze players; but the majority of players are plat or gold. 

One of the biggest issues I’ve had playing in the league so far is my teammates are giving too much respect to the diamond players. They’re afraid to push the pace, commit to ganks, invade camps etc. 

For example, we played against a D3 Viego mid last night. He got an early kill and helped with an assist. The game is 12 or 13 minutes in and Viego was 1-0-1 with no level lead. I’m playing nidalee and I’m quite ahead at 4-1-1. The enemy Kayn is irrelevant, as we killed him at red on an invade level 1, then I pathed directly to red and killed him again. 

We kill the adc bot lane, chunk the support, and push the wave. Dragon is alive & we have vision of the irrelevant Kayn top side. We have a Blitz/Kaisa bot with a Cass mid. We spot Viego passing through pixel brush and I call to start drag, but turn on him if he tries to contest. 

Our bot lane just says we should back out because they don’t want the Viego to pop off... 

What am I supposed to do in a situation like this? We have what is pretty obviously a favorable play on a silver platter, and the team just wants to give. Needless to say, both of our games against this team ended relatively quickly, as we never contested objectives or took favorable skirmishes. 

The same thing happened in another match where we were playing against the best adc in the league. He was playing Kaisa and I was playing Udyr. We’d posture over baron and I’d tell the team I have flash to stun the Kaisa. Skirmish would break out, I’d flash stun and call Kaisa’s name, but certain members on the team were scared of their tank’s posturing (even though there was space and Kaisa was barely behind the front line). 

The enemy team has Kaisa as their only damage (basically full tank / Supp elsewhere). 

What is the best way to deal with the hesitancy? Do I just keep forcing winning plays and hope the team eventually starts following-up on it? Do we all just pick hyper scaling champs so we have some semblance of a chance if we give everything for 25 minutes?",2021-04-17 20:45:24,1.0,msq20c
ncuw7hs,SazzOwl,"Tue jungle role is probably the role that got changed the most over the last years and riot was never really successful making many characters viable and balance the role in general.

I personally also don't really see how they could balance the role in the current definition for both balance and meta range.

What do you think of a more roaming support oriented approach?
I know Dota dose that too but I personally think that would change the meta on multiple positions and allows for many different strategies and play style

If the Jungler/roaming support has no farm prio and carries can take it the whole game gets a whole new dynamic because laners roam much more.

Maybe Riot make the camps much stronger so you need at least some levels and first small items to even do it and smite could still be on the roaming support but dose maybe scale with game time rather then lvl to compensate the lack of XP.

Maybe that's BS but it would definitely be an interesting change with a big impact on the whole meta",2021-04-17 20:38:36,0.0,mspyec

y15kt,bennwaa,"Imagine amateur/academy teams being tied to a region. It’s not like these players already live in LA to play in LCS. 

Maybe we could introduce this to amateur first and eventually academy. For example, Dignitas just sponsored a team from Montreal for their amateur named Mirage. I’m sure if this continues for many splits eventually Fans from Montreal and surrounding areas will be more interested in supporting Dig in the lcs. Could lead to having lcs orgs drawing fans from afar for reasons besides success. Kinda like In EU where regional leagues come from specific countries and LEC teams are like magnets for fans from the countries they have regional teams in. 

Just a thought I’ve had for a while, open for criticism.

gl8rj,TastyChocoWaffle,"In my opinion, what makes jungling so difficult are teammates. Every game I play, every team mate wants me to play around them. Some people do not seem to understand that, if I make a play on the other side of the map, then the other side will have to suffer for a bit. 

If I do a little bit terrible, teammates start to flame and self implode and then the whole game collapses. What makes it even worse is when you know you have a bad game, and someone on your team adds you just to flame. 

I am a player who does not type, so when I swap to other roles, this abuse does not happen at all. Jungling is such a terrible role to play, and when no one wants to play this role, who do we have to blame? The playerbase, or the playstyle? Riot honestly needs to just remove the jungle entirely and let people duo top at this rate.

zw2e0wm,phoenixsaturn,"I'll preface this by saying I am not a top main (though I play with friends who are). I do play a fair bit of jungle so that I'm at least somewhat competent in the role when people who are autofilled inevitably beg to swap with someone and so I could understand the role better and how to help them. Thus my opinion is coming from someone who is much more versed in jungle than in toplane.

I've played a bit of Gwen. Her early clear isn't great, but it's doable. After level 4 things get a lot smoother and she begins to clear camps with ease with Q and E. I've seen many people playing her top talk about how difficult it is to CS with her and how most toplaners bully her into oblivion. That isn't such an issue in jungle except in specific matchups where people try to invade you constantly anyways. I've also seen comments about her W and how useless it feels in toplane- Melees will either just go in it to fight you or ranged toplaners will run away until the effect is over, then go back to bullying you. 

You know what W feels really good for? Ganking a mispositioned ADC. Their support will have a hard time peeling you when they either waste their CC in your W or have to wait for it to end while you are attacking their squishy ADC (and hopefully your ADC and support are joining in the fight). Gwen's W is perfect for early dragon taking too, as the dragon itself can't attack Gwen while she's in it, giving you free attacks on it.

I'd agree with people saying her ganks lack CC without her ult, which is true. It's still hard to get people to stay in place for your Q, meaning she'll be best paired with laners and/or supports that can really lock a target down for a bit. I've tried Glacial on her, which at least forces people to somewhat stay in your Q, though you lose out on taking a damage or sustain rune as a result. But at least you're not getting bullied to hell toplane making the game a 4v5 later and jungle Gwen seems to make a lot more sense to me with how her W works. 

I think that in either top or jungle, her Q rooting her for its duration feels bad, especially given she has no cc except a tepid slow on her ult to try to keep people in its range. I really wish she had been allowed to keep the sewing ability that tied two people together and stunned them, though I'm sure that kind of ability would have pushed her even more into jungling.",2021-04-18 02:54:11,0.0,mswmv1
1vgj7hn0,Adnosius,"So, in S11 I decided to main ADC. So far I'm Plat 2 on EUNE and decided to start a new account on EUW too. Some of my supports are just leaving the lane at level 3, going to ""help mid"", but by the time he is mid our mid is already dead or back, so he just goes there, put a ward and comes back on bot where I am low HP or underfarmed already because of the missing teammate + 1 gank. Some of them are even going top at level 3, leaving me to play 1vs2 for a few good minutes. What started this? The fact that some of the pros do this and they can't understand that they do that in certain situations and not on a losing side?",2021-04-18 02:19:26,0.0,msvz7a
atebpn9y,Xamirite,"Ever since Pop/Stars dropped I've become an avid listener to whatever Riot's music team produces. What I've noticed is that a lot of what League + whoever they collaborate with make just *never* gets old. Especially songs that fit your average format of 3-4 minutes accompanied by lyrics.  


Other songs I'll have on repeat for a week, get sick of, never touch again, but I can listen to songs like Drum Go Dum and Take Over for hours everyday over a course of what's been, at the time of posting this, literal months and it'll be like my first time listening. In the case a song *does* start to feel dull (Pop/Stars, for example.), it's ""lifespan"" is still considerably long. And that's if I don't start to like it again after a little while.

gnexa,Macaulyn,"I always found it strange that an item that realistically is good against any kind of damage is focused only on armor. I mean, when we build Zhonya's, its not necessarily because of its armor (I know about Seeker's Armguard, I'll get to it, just bear with me), its more because we want to avoid being completely destroyed by something we probably won't be able to avoid. The thing is, while this makes sense against assassins, it also works well against many AP champions (Karthus being the most obvious example), not to mention it just fits well for a champion's basic playstyle, if they need to get in the enemy's face for a long time (like Morgana, for her Ultimate), yet it seems like if we build an armor item when our intent is to counter the AP champions or if we just need the active to setup an Ultimate, we end up losing part of the item's value.

It seems, for me, that Seeker's Armguard should not build into Zhonya's, but instead into an item that specifically deals with AD threats, while Zhonya's should, maybe, be either given health or become just an AP and haste item (with adjustments, of course, I'm not saying it should lose armor and keep the other stats as they are). Not only would that prevent the loss of value by not having champions building useless armor when you just want the active, it would also bring some variety by giving AP champions an armor item for when they specifically need that stat. It seems like a logical choice, just like with Sheen losing its mana, to preven any value from being lost when build by manaless champions.",2021-04-18 01:20:53,0.0,msuva1
j3dzb,Fyne_,"For a while I've felt like this honestly, players don't get to naturally develop answers to strong picks and comps before Riot's two week patch comes along and changes stuff up. If balance was done even on a monthly basis with hotfixes for more problematic things I think the game would overall be healthier.

 This would probably also help the pro scene out as well as there would be more time to experiment. Such fast balancing disincentives creativity as you dont want to waste time countering the meta since in 2 weeks there will be a new one, and instead makes you want to just play whats the best until the next op comes along.",2021-04-18 03:24:18,0.0,msx895

bc5onbhd,Jago35,"So I had thought, regarding a specific scenario, has more to do with the lore and also some fan related fiction, but let's say Garen and Quinn were present somewhere and some random dude came out of nowhere and approached them, he walked up towards Quinn and called her ""My Queen"" and then proceeded to get physical, as in getting close to touch etc, what would Quinn do? Knock him out? Punch him in the face? I imagine not kill since she is not the violent type. Since the random dude is addressing a Demacian lady in such a direct/rude fashion by calling her ""my queen"" and attempt to touch her, what would the result be of this scenario?",2021-04-17 20:44:05,0.0,msq1a2

It could permise for anyone to train without being stuck in a lost game for 35 minutes cause you tried a new champ or stuff and failed. 

Maybe you could use this mode also as a sanction. Instead of perma ban, only this ""solo vs bot"" mode will be available. Toxic players could play without ruining game experience of others players. 

I also think about bad connexion. Instead of playing with 300 ping, you could play alone on your PC vs bots.

But I still think that players in normal games should have nearly the same ranks/skill to ensure the competetive fairness and prevent stompings. 

For example I had [this](https://imgur.com/a/eO982lG) game today.

It should not be possible to get such an unbalanced game, even in normals. Sadly most of my normals are either totally stomping or getting stomped because skill difference, like shown in the picture, makes the game onesided in laning without anybody actually get to play the game.

Your ranked MMR should increase your normal MMR so higher ranked players who rarely play normals dont stomp lower MMR games.",2021-04-17 06:36:41,5.0,mse9z3

7wloaxs3,Kassabad,"I love the idea of MMOs but I can't stand the genre because of two things:

1. Piss easy braindead levelling:

Why not let people chose their difficulty? Slogging through hours and hours of mind numbing dungeons and overworld quests completely ruins the genre for me. If people wanna faceroll sure give them an option for that but otherwise we really need something for the people who enjoy a challenge or at least want to have to interact with the game instead of being able to do 90% of the game's content by mashing one button over and over again with no thought to anything else.

A way this could be handled: different servers for different difficulties with the option to swap servers freely. Then there's no issue syncing people with different difficulty preferences in overworld content

Or just say fuck it and make the game have a decent difficulty right off the bat, League is already known to have a huge learning curve why not take that into an MMO? Would really freshen up the genre and make doing dungeons and getting gear satisfying instead of some skinner box shit where gamers that have never won at anything can feel rewarded for doing the most simple tasks.

2. Skill based combat

Fuck tab targeting. I swear to God if this game has that shit it's dead on arrival. Tab targeting is so boring, there's absolutely no skill besides a bit of kiting and just knowing what order to hit your buttons

Screw this stat check meta, implement a fun combat system where you feel engaged, your champion is actually hitting someone, and YOU CAN EVEN DODGE OR BLOCK ATTACKS. If you have a good combat system and levelling people will replay stuff just because it's fun to fight things and try different builds. Just look at Dark Souls! But make even more variety and the combat doesn't have to be that punishing.

If the combat is fun and fluid and levelling is fun, this game will be great. The genre is so fucking stale and doesn't need another WoW/FFXIV clone where you just do braindead shit with no engagement for 30 hours before hitting endgame so you can do the ""real"" content that consists of a small handful of higher difficulty raids. 

I don't care how many of my favourite champs are in the game if I have to sit through 30 hours of button mashing before the game has any small semblance of challenge then I ain't playing that shit",2021-04-18 00:57:36,0.0,msufh3

Yes, I can and do mute people like this in game but jesus... this game has THE WORST community of any video game I've ever played.

The highs of winning and positive teammates used to override the extreme lows of incredibly toxic community members and needless loses. This game has become a net loss for me (in terms of my mental state) when I used to use it to unwind.

1ob5xp6n,MetaGeek1995,"OK, I have learned that any champ has their counter, and I know chogath is weak to percent damage but that isn't practical on every match up.

Just had a game trying to learn Gwen. My jungler was very good at ganking and got me ahead of cho a decent amount, but yet, he still STILL could not be fought one v one, was too oppressive to farm against so he got ahead ganks be damned, and even early on his ult freaking executed me at HALF MY ENTIRE HP BAR. 

I just really, really do not see how this is at all fair or balanced. Feels like he counters pretty much anyone he can freaking reach. Don't tell me kiting either cause his spike have enough range that unless you have a crap tone of cc or a very high range yourself you are screwed trying to run. 

What am i missing here? Where is his weakness outside just not playing a melee character? If that is his ONLY counter that is freaking bull crap.

I am sure I will get ratioed by people saying, he isn't that bad or qss but i rarely ever got hit by the actual knock up. I was counter ganked at bad times as well but he took off so fast from an equal amount of ganks and kills that I had while i struggled to just not get pushed out of lane. 

Just tell me please how do I deal with cho, not by champ select but in general. He just feels bad to play against. It isnt fun and anyone in remotely melee range who isn't also a tank seems screwed.",2021-04-17 15:14:37,0.0,msm6fb

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*order in team standings, not player ranking

(order : MAD-RGE-G2-S04-FNC-SK)

&#x200B;

**\[TOP\]**

**Armut:** Turkish delight

**Odoamne:** Great split but sad ending

**Wunder:** You should practice more

**BrokenBlade:** great mechanics, solid fundamentals

**Bwipo:** Wake the hell up buddy. I know you can do better

**Jenax:** Decent playoff-level player

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**JUNGLE**

**Elyoya:** Never expected him to be this fucking good

**Inspired:** Refine himself a little more and he will be the perfect replacement for Jankos

**Jankos:** Greatest EU jungler of all time (aka “Old man Jan”) not enjoying his pre-retirement days’ jungle meta

**Gillius:** Not the best but always needed, not brilliant but irreplaceable

**Selfmade:** I personally didn’t count on him so no surprise

**Tynx:** Thought you would do better than Elyoya

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**MID**

**Humanoid:** Surpassed all expectation. Enjoyed his drug-like plays all split long

**Larssen:** Came up a little short, but always the Mr.Reliable of Rogue

**Caps:** Tough split. Well done

**Abbedagge:** When will your full potential be realized

**Nisqy:** Tough split. Well done (2)

**Blue:** Hey you were supposed to be the next Caps

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ADC**

**Carzzy:** Keep up with his rookie-season aggressiveness and he will be at the top soon enough.

**Hans sama:** May have passed the threshold? Evolution of the super aggressive ADC

**Rekkles:** Shines best at carry role, chooses support role. He ain’t bad at it so can’t complain I guess

**Neon:** Patrik would cut off his arm to be in his position

**Upset:** Good performance overall

**Jezu:** New French hope? Showed some potential

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**SUPPORT**

**Kaiser:** Volatile performance, got carried in the finals. But definitely has that talent

**Trymbi:** Proved himself in the finals why he was the EM superstar

**Mikyx:** Solid season. Big big disappointment in the playoffs

**Limit:** If he had better ADC...

**Hylissang**: May the remaining split be his best not his last

**Treatz:** Hard work finally paying off

e9fy5,darkdill,"[Eternal Return: Black Survival](https://playeternalreturn.com/) is a Korean-made MOBA/Battle Royale game that I've recently gotten into, and though it's still in the early access stage, it's quite enjoyable. Some characters clearly borrow abilities from other MOBA titles, but a few have some abilities that I can't find a reasonable comparison to.

One of them is [Nadine](https://eternalreturn.fandom.com/wiki/Nadine). While her Q is basically the same as Varus, and her trait is very similar to Kindred, her W and E are very unique.

The W has her throw a Squirrel Trap to a target location. You can then throw a second one within a few seconds. If two traps are placed close enough together, a wire connects the two, which will damage and slow any enemy that trips it. Great for blocking off chokepoints.

Her E shoots a wire to anchor itself at a target location. While the anchor is still out, she gains bonus attack speed. Reactivating the ability pulls her to the anchor, but consumes it. Helpful to throw down when you want DPS, but it's also her only means of escaping, meaning it must be used wisely (she's also squishy). Also, if she gets too far from the anchor, it breaks, meaning an enemy who knocks her too far away from it will deprive her of her only means of disengage.

There's also [Adriana](https://eternalreturn.fandom.com/wiki/Adriana), whose whole gimmick revolves around spreading flames and area denial. She's currently weak in the solo meta, but her oil slicks and flamethrower (which doesn't work the same way that Rumble's does) don't have a present parallel in League (unless I'm mistaken).

I'm sure there's others, but that's a relatively good start. Are there any others that you think could be good to adapt?",2021-04-17 07:47:49,5.0,msfl3s

7gk4vnqu,SauloJr,"› **First part**: the reasoning behind Chemtank junglers dominating.

Chemtank is not good just because of the stats or the passive; Together with Phase Rush, it's active made ganking and diving for junglers such as Hecarim and Udyr incredibly easy. Because, well, you can't just run away, literally. But why this happened?

› **Second part**: Tank Supports didn't have mythic options.

I remember very well. Posts and posts, every single day, of people who played tank supports, such as Alistar and Braum, asking for a new tanky support item because they were sick of building locket every single game ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/kcyyro/why_were_tanky_supports_completely_ignored_as/)). I remember someone even made a drawing of [Braum holding locket](https://i.imgur.com/IDchlwp.jpg).

From the example post above: *""There is ONE mythic for the entire class, Locket of the Iron Solari. Other options for them are the more expensive Tank mythics which also build out of Bamis cinder, an item you might not even want as support.""*

› **Third**: The problem started, [Patch 11.2](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-11-2-notes/) released.

Riot listened to it's community, or almost that. They were aware that people wanted more mythic options for tanky supports as Shurelyas was very 'mehh'; but they didn't want to add more items. Then, they got a genius idea! **Make tank mythics purchasable for tanky supports.**

They made Shurelya's an AP-sided mythic and **removed defensive stats from both Frostfire and Chemtank**, in order to **reduce it's price for the tanky supports**.

Alistar needed a way of getting closer to it's enemies? He can now build Chemtank. Braum needs more CC because he is underperforming? He can now build Frostfire and apply AoE slows with his AAs, to make it easier to proc his passive.

This, on paper, was an extremely good idea. But yeah, things happened; Chemtank is too cheap. Junglers such as Hecarim, Udyr (and Mundo before this patch) can have easy access to it by perma farming early game to get the item as soon as possible, and then procceding to win by snowballing.

› **Fourth**: Conclusion.

I don't know. I'm not the one whos going to come with an idea to fix all this, I not even sure if adding new items now would fix that. Chemtank got nerfed on PBE and possibly it'll just get nerfed until it becomes a legendary and irrelevant item.

This is just my opinion and it can be changed at any point, so make comments about your views.

› **TLDR:** Chemtank is OP because it was buffed for supports and now junglers can abuse it while almost no support builds it.

For example in OW, you just got a number for kills, objective time etc, but in League they tell you what you did so far but they compare you to other players in the rank. What if you got worse stats than players below your rank? Now you feel embarrassed about it. And if that is not enough, they give you a Triangle as well so you can feel even more embarrassed when your Triangle isn't Full all three points. Or if your Triangle is so small that you cannot even see it.

153zdc,Yasuicide,"PTA is designed to be single targeted burst and dps so it doesn't let you switch to another target for 6s. However if the target you're attacking dies then you don't have a target at all until the 6s are over so your bonus dps is 0.

I think it would make more sense for dps champions who use it like Vayne, if the rune resets when the affected enemy dies. That way you can always be focused on 1 enemy. Since this is a buff the damage should be slightly nerfed too ofc.

This would make the rune more functional on the champions it is designed for like Twitch, Vayne etc and more viable on other champions like Jinx. Right now it's more an assassin rune for trading on lane and 1v1ing enemies instead of an ADcarry rune. The 6s cooldown supports more of an in-out playstyle like electrocute instead of an all-in playstyle in teamfights like Conqueror or LethalTempo",2021-04-17 16:38:23,0.0,msn3xa

Do you guys even like older skins? I mostly play French Maid or Leopard Nidalee just for nostalgic but since she got so many new skins I feel like no one plays them anymore :( What's your favorite old skin? I guess mine would be Mercenary Katarina.  

Anyways, seeing Damwon Nidalee on PBE was a big hype for me. I can't wait to see more details of this skin because I really want to cosplay that skin as well! (which would be my 4th Nidalee skin in total lmao)

# This is just what I'd like to see, so please don't take it as gospel.

&#x200B;

**1: Don't overuse existing champions:**

It's okay to have them there for story reasons, maybe have Tristana and Corky for the Bandle town intro quests, but please, don't have them everywhere, that what WoW suffers with a lot, your character feeling both OP and shafted in the story.

maybe have some as secret bosses, like Fiddlesticks can only be encountered late at night, and in specific hayfields, or Trundle can only be found high in the mountains, but they are super high level, so you can't beat them until maybe max level.

just don't have them literally everywhere.

&#x200B;

**2: allow us to hide specific parts our armour:**

Similar to the Transmog system in WoW, allow us to hide our weapons, or our cloaks/shoulderpads, but for the sake of ""PvP balance"" make it player only, so the opponents can still see what weapons you have.

&#x200B;

**3: Alpha and Beta?:**

i understand this game is still **SUPER** way off, but it would be nice to see an Alpha or Beta when the game is *""stable""* enough to play, ***maybe toss a key my way, ehh ehh?***

&#x200B;

**4: keep to the current artstyle:**

let's be real, you can run League on a potato, and it works, and we can all admit, League, in both game and cinematics, has never looked bad.

so, with that said, if it ain't broke don't fix it, don't add extra work to something that people already like, and are used too.

save time by using the current artstyle.

reduces system requirements ""*i think"".*

and give players a sense of familiarity.

&#x200B;

**5: Don't try to mimic WoW, build on what it did:**

This is gonna be challenging

WoW defined the MMO genre, and while the game nowadays is...*questionable*, it did a ton of things right when it launched

and i understand that obviously this is an impossible request, you can't completely cut out WoW from an MMO

but don't be scared to try something new, even if it doesn't work, you at least tried.

&#x200B;

**6: Don't make PvP into league 2:**

If i want to play league, i'll play league, not MMO league, just *try to avoid League...in a league MMO...*

okay, my point is, don't make an MMO MOBA for PvP.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those are some things i'd like to see when we do get some more news, but for the most part, as a WoW player of 9 years, and getting rather sick of the game's current direction.

Rek'sai has become my favorite jungler to the point where she's the only champ that makes me want to play Jungle, considering of her healthy clearing and her E tunnels that making her ganks and transportation easier with her high early damage and knockup.

I think the idea of her tunnels, along side of her bipedal look in her animations like her Q spin and diving Ult are interesting to incorporate unique VFX onto imo.

Also picking the Unusual/Unfitting ones leads to more different sets of skinlines to chose from personally.

n0f56mb,SentientAsshole,"You may have already seen, Yorick’s winrate has plummeted in 11.8 -

In Platinum+ : It’s lower now than it was pre-buff 11.6

And some of you may say - “it’s barely been a few days, his winrate hasn’t settled yet” - well, it only took two days after his initial buff for Riot to consider that “settled” and already start rolling  out nerfs on the PBE. 

Also, what is the point of the tower aggro changes when we don’t even do enough damage now to split push effectively against the majority of top laners? If we split push and they contest, we die due to being out damaged in nearly every 1v1 - especially now since our damage scaling is so much worse. His early game is weak and now we can’t even look forward to a quality mid/late game scaling.

It is so discouraging to pour out countless hours to learn a champion that will never be viable after bronze/silver/gold. What’s the point of learning a champion that is intentionally cucked by Riot in high elo?

The real issue with Yorick - is that Riot refuses to listen to Yorick’s Platinum+ dedicated player base. I mean, it’s not like there is a ton of us or that it would be difficult to find us. They refuse to listen to our representatives like Krykey, Ninetales, and many others. And believe me, they have tried tirelessly to reach Riot on our behalf. 

A few months ago a member of the balance team made a post on r/Yorickmains page actually asking us Yorick onetricks/mains what we would change about our favorite champion. It’s obvious with the buffs they made, they didn’t listen to a single comment on that post. Not one of us asked for a ridiculous meme burst damage leap on his E.

Unlike the Wukong treatment, where they worked hand in hand with the player base - Riot doesn’t seem to care at all about the player base who actually plays Yorick and loves the champion for more than just free elo on a flavor of the month patch. As I watch certain streams of Riot employees talk about Yorick - they are so out of touch with the identity of the champion. The identity of a champion regardless of how much they can try to bend it to their will, is always found in the high elo player base that finds a strategy to make said champion viable in high skilled matches.

TLDR: It feels like Riot doesn’t care about Yorick because Riot doesn’t care about Yorick’s core player base and what they have to say. I know Yorick’s core player base isn’t the only group that strongly feels this way. It simply won’t be a quick fix, Yorick really needs the Wukong treatment.",2021-04-16 08:00:43,106.0,mrrd6m

p04ze3m,DRtedybear,"I wanted to rank all mythics because I thought it would be fun. This is just my opinion and i will have the list first if you just want to see it. I will then give reasoning after

WORST-BEST

F-tier

23. Mandate

22. riftmaker

D-tier

21. night harvster

c-tier

20. gore drinker

19. Duskblade

18. shurelya's

b-tier, B - tier is in no particular order and I think these are the good ones that serve there purpose of mythics.

17. eclipse

16. Frostfire gauntlet

15. tri force

14. divine sunderer

13. Luden's

12. stridebreaker

11. everfrost

10. locket

9. liandry's

8. sunfire

A Tier, these mythics are really good

7. prowler's claw

6. shieldbow

5. galeforce.

4. kraken slayer.

S tier - you can basically go these every game if your champ goes this mythic.

3. moonstone renewer

2. turbo chemtank.

1. rocketbelt

&#x200B;

ok so reasoning

F-tier, 

mandate - this item is really bad. Enchanters and supports are the ones that are supposed to go this item, but  supports and enchanters offering damage is not their job so the idea of it makes no sense. Also the damage on it is so low it is hilarious. your allies have to proc it to do damage and it is super inconsistent if you have an adc that is dead or in a bad position your damage is gone

riftmaker - the damage is so low it is funny. offering up to 10% bonus true damage sounds good but is really bad. You are supposed to get mythic first item but, if you get this at the start you need your champion to have the numbers to make the % damage you do worth it. Let's say I am playing Vladimir, I could do more damage if I went ludens or liandry's. Not to mention, I need to fight for 5 seconds to get the true damage off. So I can do this in the early game easily, but I won't have the damage. Late game the % extra bonus damage is good but, how often as an ap bruiser are you gonna have 5 seconds. You also need even more time to do damage. The omnivamp and health are the only things that makes it somewhat good.

&#x200B;

D Tier - 

Night harvester - I am gonna get a lot of confusion with this one but, I can explain. Ok so first the stats of the item, 90 ap, 15 ability haste, 300 health. These stats are fine, pretty good for a bruiser but the active is really bad. Ok so you do 125(+15%) ap with this item. Let's assume you have a doran's or maybe some adaptive ap in minor runes, you will have around 100 ap so the active is 140 ap damage. Take in too consideration that enemies might have resistances. let's say you are going against viktor and you get this item at level 10 and you both are  level 10. He will have a base amount of 33 mr, so you will do 112 dmg with night harvester. He is going to have base health of 1226.  So a proc will get him only 1,114 health. The damage is so low it is actually funny. This item also does better in the early game. In the late game you might have a few items and get the damage of it to 170 lets say. Let us also say you are going against a Vayne at level 15 in the late game. she will have a base of 36 mr. So 170 against 36 mr you are only doing 125 dmg. She will also have a base 1695 hp. So here remaining health is only 1,570. I can get the argument that you can apply this to all enemies, yes you can but there are a lot of tank supports and bruisers right now. They will have higher base MR than ranged champions and most likely build resistances, so the damage is even lower.

C tier- 

I think these items are a lot better than the previous ones so keep that in mind.

goredrinker - With the nerf to missing health, the healing from it is very small plus with grievous wounds items more accessible and better it is really hard to get a good amount of healing. The damage of the active is pretty good but stridebeaker just does better than it.

Duskblade - the active damage of it is pretty small. I don't really see anyone getting more than 1000 dmg with it. Going Invis with it is pretty strong, it can confuse enemies and allow to get more kills and escape. I do feel that the damage is low so it is harder to kill people with duskblade than if you had a different ad assasin mythic. The ability hast mythic passive also is pretty weak compared to the others.

Shurelya's - I could be wrong since it did just get a mini rework but, I think it is still the same or weaker. The active is strong but giving allies 25% ms is good but, old staff did as well but gave you both the MS and even ap, it gaveless ms but I think it was better. The worst part I think is the 5 ability haste instead of the 3% ms. 

B tier - 

eclipse

 Frostfire gauntlet

 tri force

 divine sunderer . 

Luden's

 stridebreaker

. everfrost

 locket

liandry's

 sunfire

I think the b tier's are fine, they do there job. I have all the ap mana mythics here because they are just too expensive to be good enough.

A tier -

Prowler's claw - It gives 21 lethality, the other assasins give 18 lethality. Also the mythic passive of giving it 5 lethality offers a lot of damage. Plus you can prowler's claw minions to get closer to enemies.

Immortal shieldbow-

Kraken Slayer -

Gale Force - I think the marksman mythics are all really strong and you can choose which one you want to go based on the game, other than really Jhin since kraken is useless. 

S - tier

Moonstone renewer - I think the changes to this item is a buff to some champs and a nerf to others. I think it is a nerf to Seraphine since the heal and shield boost is not great on her since she has a super long cooldown on shield. She was great with moonstone since she could proc it from really far away. Now with more relying on heals and shields nerfs her a bit. I think it is either the same or better on champs like Nami, Ivern, Karma, Lulu, Janna. I think it is even better on Yuumi since her heal has a strong base heal pretty low ap ratio. Bonus heal and shield really boosts it. Also Yuumi was not the greatest with Moonstone since cooldowns are kind of long compared to other enchanters, also a bug fix she can no longer proc the heal active on moonstone with w2. 

I think this change buffs Soraka however. Soraka offers arguably but probably the best healing in the game. In the late game she is super strong with low cooldown on her heal ability. So she can proc moonstone easier than others and the heal and shield on it helps her a lot.

Turbo Chemtank - super strong. You can get on too people very easily and why we see a lot of Skarner, Udyr, Rammus, Volibear, hecarim and Mundo. It is super strong and super cheap at only 2800 gold. 

1. Rocket Belt - This could be a little bit of an overaction. I do think this item is super strong. it is 100.34% gold efficient, but it calculates the gold of Magic pen 0f 47.08 gold per point of it. I would say it is more gold efficient, but that is why gold value is a little low. 

250 health, 6 magic pen, 15 ability haste, 90 ap, all good stats. The Mythic passive of 5 magic pen is really strong. The active does more damage than night harvester since the flat magic pen will do more. the 30% ms and a dash to get to enemies or away from them is super strong. It offers champions with low mobility a good dash. Plus this is on a 40 second cooldown. Gale force dash is on a  90 second cooldown, prowlers claw is on a 60 second cooldown. Stridebreaker is on a 20 second cooldown and reduced by ability haste.

Reference for dash range, prowlers claw is the longest at 500, but is a targeted ability.

Second is gale force at 425 range.

3rd is stridebreaker at 300 range 

rocketbelt is 4th at 275 range, but it also adds 30% ms to remember.",2021-04-17 03:07:19,3.0,msa55h
5dhx1hf4,DONGOMASTER,"Currently I think Triforce is one of the worst mythics in the game. The subset of characters that it is actually viable on is pretty low considering the conditions that are required for the item to even do anything in-game.

Let's take a look at its base stats:

\+30 [attack damage](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_damage)

\+20 [ability haste](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_haste)

\+30% [attack speed](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_speed)

\+200 [health](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Health)

This item gives you a combination of attack speed, ability haste, damage, and health.

Currently, the way that this item's passive, Threefold Strike works is this:

**UNIQUE –** [**THREEFOLD STRIKE**](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Named_item_effect#Threefold_Strike)**:** Basic attacks grant 25 **bonus** movement speed for 3 seconds and, if the target is a champion or a structure, increase **base** attack damage by 6% for the same duration, stacking up to 5 times for a 30% increase.

Why does this passive only really synergize with two components on the item? Attack Damage and Attack Speed?

Getting to maximum Triforce stacks happens so rarely in mid-lategame fights simply due to the fact that **trying to autoattack somebody 5 times will mean that either you're dead or your target is dead.** The only time you usually get 5 stacks is when you're focusing a tank down (but why didn't you just go Divine Sunderer then?)

**You are weaving in spells, activating spellblade, and using the rest of your kit in your attempt to land 5 autos.** I believe the only characters who can actually leverage this passive are those whose entire kit revolves around autoattacks (Jax, Master Yi, Tryndamere, Camille, Xin Zhao).

What if instead, Triforce had its stacks adjusted to 6-8 stacks (total damage boost unchanged), and ability hits on champions now granted a stack of Threefold Strike?

One of the most frustrating parts about using Triforce is that you can **only stack it on autoattacks**. It gets to the point where it actively feels bad to use your damaging abilities in lieu of your autoattacks in certain situations because

1. Your stacks can fall off while, say, you're kiting someone with Jax's E around bushes.
2. Your stacks are about to fall off and you used your ability to secure a kill instead of your autoattack. Nice, they're gone now.
3. You're a melee who's getting kited. The item is simply **fucking unusable** unless you have **hilarious mobility.** It would be great if there was competition with **Stridebreaker** in the top lane. Perhaps Triforce can fill the niche of being the 'damage' bruiser item, while stridebreaker is the 'mobility' item and Goredrinker is the 'sustain' item. Triforce right now is simply the 'shit' item.
4. You like spellblade but your champion isn't intended to fucking somehow land 5 autoattacks on a champion consecutively. (Gangplank? His itemization is so fucking horrible because of this).
5. **You have** **3 fucking seconds to keep your stacks up. WHO DESIGNED THIS ITEM.**

As long as the number of stacks required to reach 30% bonus base AD is increased, I can only see a change like this actually making Triforce usable for a subset of champions. Right now, I see this item built maybe once every 20 games likely due to how unbelievably shitty its passive feels in-game.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Another fix I can think of is that your Threefold Strike passive simply does not fall off as long as you're in Champion combat. This would also be a great fix to increase its usability.",2021-04-17 08:53:50,0.0,msgoqb
4hsfboi7,MooseMaster3000,"Preface: His kit's always been solid, but very dependent on the state of his class's items. My goal here is to give him a little more wiggle room when his items take hits and open up the possibility of support, instead of changing his shield entirely like I really want to.

Champions like Gwen, Mordekaiser and Diana (maybe even Rumble, Kayle and AP Volibear) would probably start building an item with HP, AP, CDR and AS (basically an AP equivalent of Stridebreaker/Trinity stat wise) and will, at the very least, consider it as an extra option (buzzword: BUILD VARIETY!!!)",2021-04-17 00:19:53,5.0,ms6nze
9o410,Koutsokostas,"This isn't a sob post or any of that sort, it's just that jungle feels extremely unrewarding and anti-fun to play as a role, which impacts the issue of its low popularity. There are numerous reasons as to why jungle feels awful, despite its importance and impact in the game.



Primarily, the importance of the scuttle crab forces a lot of non-hard CC junglers out of viability, and it extremely limits the champion pool available. This is primarily the biggest offense that creates a lot of issues with the jungle as seen in a recent post here in this subreddit ([The post that discusses the issues in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mnhnhf/all_of_jungles_issues_stem_from_the_introduction/)), however, it is not the only issue, but a progenitor of multiple issues within the jungle right now. 



Moreover, while I think the XP right now curves well with solo lanes, I find it extremely unhealthy that jungle is the only role that level disparities can be that massive. This is in particular an issue that was mostly prevalent in the top lane, however, in the jungle currently, given the importance of XP and objectives (Dragon, Baron, Scuttles), whomever falls behind in XP by a little, is punished heavily as XP in the jungle snowballs (its not uncommon to see 3-5 level difference in the Jungle, meaning one team has a severely underpowered smite, and thus a much harder time to compete for objectives), this in its own makes jungle feel extremely unpleasant as a role, which hinders its popularity in the game, and the games are often decided by whomever has a jungle player and which team has an auto-filled jungle player.



Furthermore, Riot has been trying to increase the pool of champions that *can* Jungle, without addressing the problem of the limited pool of junglers that can *effectively* jungle. While I do personally enjoy jungle Morgana, it feels awful that there are so many neglected junglers, who have multiple issues (bugs, costs etc) such as Kindred or Amumu, who were made with the role in mind, but have been barely looked at (took 3 years to fix a crucial wolf bug for Kindred). There are more champions who have these sort of issues, but that is not the point, the point is that Riot's widening of champion availability for the jungle was done with the low popularity of jungle in mind, but the reason as to why jungle is that unpopular is because it is unpleasant to play. 



Lastly, it is a difficult role. A lot of players do say that jungle is easy, however, jungle requires a lot of different fundamentals that the average laner does not have. Kiting the camps effectively, macro knowledge and correct pathing, knowing lane matchups (very crucial and impacts pathing and match macro), camp/objective timers, efficient warding/vision control and of course, the most important, a cooperating team. Of course, in details there are way more that in my opinion make Jungle much more difficult as a role than any of the laning roles (I am an ADC/MID with Jungle as my third role, but I started this game back in season 1 as a Jungler). The reason jungle is so unpopular, is simply because it is not a simple role, and not because it has a small champion pool (it doesn't). There are way more problems to cover about the jungle, but it just feels so tilting and anti-fun to play compared to lanes, and given its high impact on the game, it feels extremely stressful and difficult to play compared to other roles. Maybe I just don't know what I am talking about because I peaked Platinum 2, but the role just feels awful to play, and its intricacies keep a lot of players off from playing it, and make it feel extremely awful. It has been like that for a while now, but it has been getting worse as time passed.



Maybe I can be wrong, and that is fair to a debate, but these are my two cents on why jungle is unpopular and why it feels bad to play.

d63y4,Itikiti,"Now I know what you're thinking: ""Isn't Viego supposed to be the yasuo of the jungle?"" Well, while he is an edgy swordman he's not an edgy *anime* swordsman. Plus, I'd argue Viego is based more around the posession mechanic and being a part of ruination storyline.

Therefore, we need a yasuo for the jungle. Whether a new champ or a rework for one of the bros, give me a 2 levels down, 70% of a laner's income Crit Creep so I can stop being autofilled jg and can solo lane for once.",2021-04-17 13:46:37,0.0,msl2ms

j4xbfjh,NewLunarKnights,"I pretty much only play draft pick with friends right now. I’m usually support but I picked up Viego and I really like him so I’ve been trying out jungling on him. I’ve got camp clearing and routes down alright, but I feel that I never have any opportunity to gank. My friends are much higher level than me and they rarely ever play under our own turrets. They’re usually pushed pretty aggressive. Either by the time I get there the enemy will be way back down their own lane or they really just don’t need the gank and are fine; again they’re are much more skilled than I am.

On top of that, I do well against camps but when it comes to 1v1ing it just feels like I don’t do any damage. I combo, try to get my passive off as much as possible, but I’m always either outdamaged, or worse, outhealed even though my damage could keep up. I dread fighting against enemies that have lots of life steal, and I feel that especially early game I’m just being useless. Warwick is especially annoying for me, I can never win a 1v1 with him even if I’m ahead in levels or items; he just hits me a couple times and he’s back to full health. I usually have second to last or so damage, and they often (jokingly of course) flame me about how xyz champion who just cc’s or whatever did more damage than I did. In the end we do usually still win, because like I said my friends are like level 400+, but I just feel useless when I jungle. What can I do to have more impact?

5mlvb87f,InitialiseCasts,"They're back! Having lost to V3 Esports last summer, **DFM** have returned the favour in Spring 2021 to become the LJL champions once more... in eerily mirrored splits, no less (Riot script writers, please).

For those wanting a TL;DR of the action and how this revamped DFM roster are looking heading into MSI, we gotchu - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQxSs9aS2zc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQxSs9aS2zc)

Couple things to note:  
**- Ceros is gone**.  
... well, kinda. He's the sub mid now, replaced by LJL god of the midlane **Aria** \- a Korean wunderkid with 1k+ LP in Challenger, who's been the best mid in the LJL for the last 2+ years. He's our Caps, basically.

**- Their current Support is actually one of their coaches**  
Current support, **Kazu**, is actually one of DFM's coaches who's stepping in for the Spring Split due to import restrictions (more on that later). He is an ex-pro, so he's not entirely without mechanics... but he can't resist the lure of a flashy engage even if no-one is there to back him up. (see the coinflip in action: [heads](https://www.twitch.tv/ljl_officially_unofficial/clip/VainSwissMeerkatPlanking?filter=clips&range=30d&sort=time) / [tails](https://clips.twitch.tv/SuperIcyKangarooSoBayed-0nrgeVRrSgSPN29e)).

**- The DFM Exodia isn't complete - yet**.  
Come Summer, the training weights come off because jungler **Steal** gets residency. That means longtime LJL and DFM support god **Gaeng** gets to re-join the starting roster and complete the LJL's very own Forbidden One.

With a planned summer lineup of Evi / Steal / Aria / Yutapon / Gaeng, DFM will be running a squad with arguably **the best players in every role** in the LJL - and they'll still have Ceros and his mad midlane picks in their back-pocket, too.

Of course, for MSI the Left Leg of Exodia isn't yet in play, and so there's defintiely weknesses to exploit (especially around Kazu). That, and Group C is absolutely stacked with both Damwon Kia and Cloud9 also being a part of it...

Still, as far as opportunities to grow and internationally blood your superstar midlaner in preparation for Summer (and Worlds), who better to have as sparring partners than the reigning MSI and World Champion Midlaners, Perkz and Showmaker? Here's hoping Aria and DFM put on a show!

So I made the mistake of thinking ranked is a good idea. I played 3 games today, all 3 of those I had a toplaner that wanted to play Gwen.  2 games my team banned it and they went apeshit and ran down. The 3rd one got Gwen and ran down anyway. 

I always get this kind of bs the second a new champ comes out and once some fool sets his mind on ranked grinding it for the first time there is basically no way to win the game anymore. I am hardstuck silver/gold because I can't carry games like that, especially not on my main role support.

With this I turn to you, oh lovely community. What is your advice on what to do when the next 200IQ mastermind decides to lock Gwen in ranked?

You're sitting here screeching that people need to take a few weeks to learn the champion in norms even though you could just sit out of ranked for a few weeks, learning how to play as/with/against her in norms yourself while avoiding the supposed problem entirely.

Which not only leaves the people who don't care free to play it and give Riot the data they need to make adjustments, but is also an actual solution. 

Think about it, just for a second. The people who pick new champions in ranked are *already* the type who refuse to swap to norms. They're just going to continue playing ranked with their usual picks until the champion's available. *All that does is postpone the wave of first-timers*.

28vg1359,Dontspinbutwin,"This applies to all things, from meta to rotations. I understand wanting to copy your favorite youtuber or twitch streamer, but if you do something without knowing why it works, then it can be detrimental or not fully used to its potential, which undermines the point of using the said thing.

Take the current ezreal meta build right now, for example: Its an essence reaver rush into a duskblade. The whole point of it is to use a bunch of damage early on to secure a massive lead to midgame, and win before lategame. However, if an ezreal decides to not use the extra damage used in this build to secure a massive lead before lategame, he is essentially capping his potential, and limiting the maximum he can do for his team.

Then there's conqueror. It's a good rune that is never fully optimized because ""Well, the pros go it so it must be good!"", and that's just maddening to hear in a debate about proper runes. However, since you need to fully stack it, and then be able to fight with those stacks, to effectively use conqueror, it isn't just enough to stack it. You need to be able to find a way to sustain damage/avoid damage (with fully stacked conqueror), have high enough damage to actually heal off the percentage of damage done with conqueror, and be able to reliably apply that damage to the enemy. As such, I genuinely believe the majority of ranged champions can't effectively use conqueror, even though they can easily stack it fairly quickly. This also applies to certain juggernauts. If the enemy has 5 ranged champions, and I play Darius, chances are I won't be able to effectively stick onto them. As such, while conqueror is a decent rune on Darius, in this specific scenario, phase rush would probably be a better rune. By knowing how and when conqueror is effective, a player can actually choose the most optimal rune per match, instead of slapping on conqueror every game then wondering why it doesnt work.

I can honestly keep going with examples, but why am i bringing this up? I simply just hate people who blindly follow whatever is popular. It doesnt let players experiment, or find new metas. The cycle then becomes someone randomly tries something, usually a twitch streamer, a korean challenger, or a pro during worlds, then people only copy that build/runes, without knowing why it works (like how players went ap mf support for the longest time simply because it was in worlds, without knowing the fact that it was only used to counterpick zyra support). Maybe a proplayer finds success with Ap rammus support, but thats only because in challenger supports have proper game sense. If a silver 3 support decides to play ap rammus support every game while their opponent lacks game knowledge, then that silver 3 support would end up being a detriment to their team, simply because ""a pro did it so it must be good!""

Learn why something sucks/isnt meta, and you can find solutions/alter the meta. I love illaoi to death, but since she's so immobile and projected, she's easily countered. So what do I do? Frostfire to slow them with my W (so they cant avoid tentacle slams), tear of the goddess to harass in lane, and suddenly ""omg illaoi is so braindead"".  Lets say I play pantheon but the enemy decides to play yi. I can slap on press the attack, get kraken slayer/bork, and suddenly become a dps machine with my empowered W.

&#x200B;

TLDR: There's so much potential with the numerous champions, runes, items, matchups, and almost all of that is thrown to the wind because ""I'm gonna copy this 1 thing for all these different scenarios because a pro did it"", and thats such a damn shame to see.",2021-04-16 20:19:35,5.0,ms1yis

2f1r9l2,PowerPulser,"Every game wether it's won or loss just feels the same, for every role and every build choice. 

I don't know how, but items now feel even less impactful than before, especially support items. 

Each game is basically some laning phase with some kills and then we go straight to fighting and it just lacks of depth. If i play well or if i do not play well it doesn't seem to change the outcome as much as it should. It may be my noob self speaking but the game feels more like a coin toss rather than a game of skill.

153zdc,Yasuicide,"I think that selling items like GA while they are on cooldown (when full build) is an unhealthy strategy that still doesn't require any skill and is just simply annoying to do. Deathsdance for example provides the same item stats in better and there's technically no reason to not constantly switch between it and GA (switching just once before the last teamfight should be fine).

Same goes for Zhonyas vs high AP teams where armor is no real value and also for Mercurial/Silvermere which have pretty shitty stats in general making it too worth to sell them before a fight while on CD.

So to not make items actives abusable I think it would be best to pause their cooldowns while you are outside of your fountain and the item is not in your inventory. At least for GA",2021-04-17 13:57:43,0.0,msl7nk

Is it just me, or has the meta for laning phase shifted completely to a sedentary, farm-focused snooze fest?

I've hardly seen any solo kills, jungle invades looking for kills, mid lane duels to the death. It's all just peaceful farming, or trading/harassing the opposing laner until they back to base and teleport right back.

An embarrassing rant. 

To anyone more familiar with the future plans of league of legends, do you know if Riot is planning to add any more permanent maps?

I just got done with a custom game where I got into an argument with someone about what a bruiser is and what bruiser items are.

Embarrassingly the argument was brought on about the fact that before the game I said “No tank or bruiser champions” later changed to “no tank items”. I was kind of annoyed by players in custom games playing tank and bruiser champions just to kill any ounce of potential fun.

The point I am trying to make is that it really sucks that you are forced to play summoners rift where you can choose what champion to play but even in normal games it feels like you must tryhard, so if you want to play something more casual you can play aram where you can't choose champions, all that is left are custom games where people still play tanks and bruisers, not to mention you don't get xp from those, so what is left? 

So what was the point of Riot deleting twisted treeline?

I know they said it was because there were too few players playing on it, but did they have to delete it, if anyone more knowledgeable knows, did it cost money to keep the map online? 

My dream map would be a small map, 3v3, or a 4v4 with few objectives, blind pick and a lot of bushes and around the corner situations, (basically twisted treeline I know).

If Riot made anything like that I would jump on that instantly, and if not I wish that the rotating game modes changed more frequently and were more diverse.

As an outsider it seems dumb that instead of adding permanent content they keep taking away from the main game, and instead just add to summoners rift.

I probably won't be quitting the game any time soon because I spent way too much time on   it, just venting about the lack of maps and ways to play the game.  

Thank you for your time.",2021-04-17 03:15:04,0.0,msaani

9aiirvyu,an-academic-weeb,"You are an AP dps - but you never get any range.

You have a dash that reduces cooldown on target hit - but no vitals to hit. 

You are restricted by awful item choices early you need for your champ to actually functions - but once you get them, you are still useless.

Also you have now old Irelias useless ult which is now STILL useless (not to mention SLOW) - and on top of having no cc on your base abilities, the lack of a real ult makes your abyssimal teamfight power even worse. Fiora creates a strong healzone and can even get a stun of a good riposte, Kayle's ult is iconic for a decade now - heck with Kayle's slow that's still more cc than Gwen has. 

Everything seems to be built on those passive stacks, but if you do the math you can see how awful that is.  For the most times it's a 15-25 dmg on hit, and that reduced by MR. By the time you apply it enough times for it to matter, the whole fight is already over. Imagine having a passive that is a bit more useful than ""200 dmg in a teamfight if you get lucky"" - the heal added to it makes the bad joke even worse, a percentage of an an already awful number.

Like, it sounds strong on paper with the stacks, but it just doesn't hold up - being stuck in an aweful itemization niche is not exactly helping it either. Just compare her damage output to the likes of Ryze or Cassiopaia, who are also AP-DPS. Or heck, even Mordekaiser. Or Rumble. Or literally any other AP champion. 

So you have a downright AWFUL early lane, as levels do not give your skills any base damage, but then, when mid game teamfights finally roll around you - are still useless. Your moblity might be enough to reach the enemy backline, and then... nothing, since you lack any upfront damage or cc. I have never seen a champion, who mechanically takes after the likes of Xin and Fiora, be so IGNORABLE. Like, you barely have to care if she's there, and she dies the moment a minion so much as breathes at her as her item niche barely allows for tankyness. 

The literally ONLY reason she is ""viable"" on toplane, is that sometimes on top you play against melee champions who can't do much against semi-ranged bullying (Malphite, Shen, etc.). THAT'S NOT WHAT A DEDICATED TOPLANER SHOULD BE?! Not to mention that all the champions she actually CAN bully have VASTLY more teamfight power. 

Early game? Weak by design.

Mid game? Barely scraping by.

Late game? Utterly ignorable.

9nxcnns6,LPL-Official,"After a long and exciting split with explosive games 7 days a week, the end is finally near. Out of the 17 teams that went in with high hopes, now only 2 remain! The old titan Royal Never Give Up and the new age champions Funplus Phoenix. Watch a clash of two generations at the LPL finals, coming on April 18th!

**RNG’s Renewed Rise**

A long storied organization, RNG had gone through a transitional phase, ever since the retirement of longtime star anchor, Uzi. They had been struggling in previous splits after his departure, so the hopes for the team were at the most modest they had ever been coming into this split. However, they would surge back. Powered by an unexpected roleswap of longtime midlaner Xiaohu to the toplane, alongside near MVP-caliber performances from jungler Wei and support Ming, RNG would finish first in the regular season, breaking all expectations. 

Now, the pressure is on. They had looked relatively shaky entering the playoffs, but solidified their reputation after a full 5 game battle with EDward Gaming. All cylinders must be clicking for a victory this Sunday. Can they handle it?

**A True Rebirth**

To call Funplus Phoenix a dark horse coming into the playoffs would be an understatement. After a season filled with ups and downs, as well as roster uncertainty, many fans and analysts had been writing off this squad from the get go. Yet they powered on, winning four best of 5s in a row to make it here, to the final hurdle. And it is not just a roster that is on a redemption arc, but also a single man - the former Worlds FMVP, Tian. Tian had sat out a majority of the split, but came back in the playoffs with cannons blazing. Notching himself six MVPs in twelve wins in the playoffs, his ability to find teamfight flanks and bring FPX to an early game lead is still as impeccable as always.

There is more than one wall left in front of them. Not just RNG, but also themselves. FPX has one of the highest ceilings in the world, no doubt, but they also have been known to be inconsistent. They must show up in full force on Sunday, heads flipped - or the redemption arc may fall at its final hurdle.",2021-04-15 17:02:50,482.0,mrawnf

It's so tiring for me to play a bruiser or tank only to be CC'ed and melted by Liandry's Demonic Embrace. And god forbid, if I build MR; oh nvm void staff just penetrates through 40% of it.

Every mage just builds everfrost now. We're back to the cringy GLP meta where mages get a free slow on a low cooldown that allows them to land their CC with ease. Also, all mages are now burst mages. Mages have completely lost their identity as a ""sustain mage"", ""control mage"" etc. Speaking of which, there's way too much CC in this game. If you get hit by one CC ability, it's guaranteed you'll die because someone else will chain CC you. 4-5 seconds of constant CC is not okay considering how much burst there is in the game too. 

Mages are now mobile. Luden's gives them movement speed which makes safe champs like Xerath, Lux, Vel'koz even more harder to catch. Shit like sylas can breathe on you and you evaporate. Playing classic old ADCs like ashe or varus feels worthless because of how much mobility there is in the game. 

But imo, I feel like if an assassin gets a slight lead or 1 lethality item, and it's like nearly impossible to stop them. Mages have the best items in the game which grant them protection (Zhonya's and banshees) and they also have CC and burst. Like hello? Nerf AP items and lethality items please.

Yea you can say that the game is trying to balance this. But main issue here is : Game is **TRYING**,  there is no guarantee that one team doesn't gonna have premade(or sometimes even two) when another one gonna sit with 5 randoms. I am not even talk about quality of this premades, when in one team you can have botlane duo or jngl+ sololane, when in another one you gonna have something like... silver3 midlaner who are in duo with g2 otp Yuumi(just example) who don't even connect to each other in game.

1u3s8s4l,Wrakhr,"When combined, both champs' kits function very similarly, they basically try to single you out and stat check you down. Where they differ are their specific strengths, Jax has more survivability, cc and sustained damage and Gwen gets a longer engage range with her R, a stronger first rotation, and some cheats with her W.

However, while Jax typically builds items to enhance his strengths and mitigate his weaknesses. BotRK for chase and sustain, Tri-force for burst and... actually everything, and Steraks to prevent being focused down immediately in teamfights...

Gwen can't do that, she has a decent mythic in Everfrost, but that's it. Everything that comes after just feels... underwhelming. It's not even about the power of the items themselves, just that they don't work well with Gwen. Nashor's Tooth on paper sounds great and like an item that gives her everything she needs, but if she builds it, she dies to a stiff breeze, the W resistances just aren't enough. If you go Demonic Embrace, it's even worse, because she now can't kill anything. Imo her best option is something like Zhonya's, but that delays your power spikes even further.

Same thing applies to boots. Sorcs feel bad due to the true damage on Q, Lucidity because you need attack speed before you can get too much haste, due to how her Q stacks work, Mercs/Tabis because they just don't give you quite enough for the price most of the time (especially since she lacks sustain), and Berserkers because eventually with Nashor's, you'll have more AS than you can reasonably use.

tl;dr: I have no idea how to itemize on Gwen, either she dies, or she doesn't do enough damage. Please let me know if this is just me being bad, or if this is an actual issue she has.",2021-04-17 05:26:12,0.0,mscx3d

My gf has been trying to get this icon for league but can not find it in the store. She was too shy to ask Reddit and doesn’t know how so here I am. 

She’s also asked her league friends and they have no idea. Does anyone know how to obtain this icon ?

&#x200B;

I mean even outside of that, Varus builds lethality, twtich goes AP, kalista is some weird life-stealy-bruiser thing... whatever she's doing? I guess when you really look at it there is a bit of a lack of on hit items, (one of them being ardent,  an item that only enchanters build) There isn't really even much of an on hit mythic, I guess Kraken slayer does fine, but otherwise... 

&#x200B;

Is it a problem with crit being too good? Kai'sa isn't building AP items at all which suggests to me that crit is just too good to pass up on... that or there isn't any on-hit AP mythic item, so it just doesn't work too well.",2021-04-17 01:16:57,0.0,ms7vg3

#After missing out on Worlds 2020, VCS is finally back on the international stage and will be represented by GAM Esports. See you all at MSI 2021!",2021-04-18 21:16:21,259.0,mtcmpx
we007,ItsGex,"Hello guys, I was rewatching the series between Mad Lions and Rogue and I thought this play in the third map was very important to turn the series around in favor of Mad, so I have made a little infographic summarizing the play.

\- Infographic: [**https://imgur.com/a/wnMYmHc**](https://imgur.com/a/wnMYmHc)

\- Exact moment of the play: [**https://youtu.be/3N2yI9v2-2A?t=1363**](https://youtu.be/3N2yI9v2-2A?t=1363)

I leave the transcription here if you don't want to check the image:

1 - After losing the priority in top/Herald, Rogue recovers mid and bot pressure trying to secure the next Dragon.

2 - Humanoid goes back to base and uses Teleport in bot, losing mid pressure while tries to kill Hans Sama or Trymbi to recover the river with a numerical superiority.

3 - Humanoid kills Hans Sama but the ADC from Rogue gets Carzzy, turning the play in a 1 for 1 and preventing Mad Lions from controlling the river.

4 - Both junglers clean the waves in mid and bot and Elyoya moves to top to try to trade tower with Herald for Dragon, since Inspired is in bot.

5 - Inspired makes a mistake cleaning the wave and Humanoid and Kaiser kill him. In a situation where Rogue can’t take the Dragon as a result of not having a jungler, Mad Lions gets an even longer tempo window where they can take the tower without losing the bot objective.

6 - Odoamne knows he can’t defend top and uses his Teleport to recover bot’s river, killing Humanoid.

7 - Rogue takes control of the river again and Mad Lions, knowing it can’t contest Tristana and Caitlyn pressure in mid and bot, uses Armut’s priority in top while Odoamne cleans the wave to force a 5 vs 4 situation in bot with the Teleport of the toplaner, killing Hans Sama and getting the Dragon as a result.

8 - Rogue ends up getting 2 kills while Mad Lions gets one dragon, Herald, one tower and 3 kills, eliminating the 2K gold difference between them and Rogue and recovering the control of the game.",2021-04-19 01:01:23,6445.0,mtgpzj

bbabx,Kjndst,"After \~30 games with Gwen and alot of research with matchup, runes, itemization i think i can say that after the hotfix Gwen number is kinda OK now.

Lvl 1 E give her 40% atk speed + 10 on-hit damage ( without any item. If you buy doran ring it will be 12 ) Thats basically a Irelia with max stack passive at lvl 1.

Q at max lvl deal 210 True Dmg at the center with 3.5s cd, combo Q with E dash you basically have the damage of ( Fiora Q x 2 )

Her base armor is 39 and armor grow is 4. Its the same as Darius. She have 107 armor at lvl 18 only lower than Mega Gnar, Braum, Rammus, Leona and Urgot. Combine that with her W and you have a fuckton of armor thats only lower than Rammus and Malphite. Some people didnt realise that she's **VERY** tanky in W.

Fck her Ult because the Range + Damage is great but its mean nothing because enemy just run the fck away when she use R1.

After spend more than 3 days play and research about Gwen i feel like her kit is not that hard to master. Compare to something like Garen, then Ok it might take more effort to know how to use the ability effectively. But its only take you a few more games than Garen to understand her kit and trade pattern. I have to say that she might have high skill floor but not high skill ceiling.

Gwen winrate is low not just she is new and people dont know how to play her. But the problem also there in her kit. What she have is damage and only damage. No utility, no cc, just damage. So when you are behind, you are useless.

She dont have a way to regen back in lane safely, if you want to regen the only way is too deal damage to enemy champion and its very dangerous when you are behind. Because she dont have anyform of cc its almost guarantee that enemy champion will trade back and chunk more of her HP than what she regen from the trade.

She HAVE TO hit enemy champion with basic atk or center of her Q ( which have the reach lower than Urgot ) to regen back. Yes i'm ok with that.

She also have problem with sticking to enemy when they runing away. Lets say that you use your R1 to slow them down. But after that you have to hit something to fire R2, R3. Yes she have a dash but its a 350 range dash with 9s cd if u dont hit anything. So if enemy is more than 600 range away then the best result you can do is burn their flash. I cant recall how manytime enemy run away from me after i used my R1.

Her kit have a veryclear downsite that you HAVE TO hit something between ability to stay functional. Yes i'm also ok with that.

She stay in place for 0.5s when casting Q, with the only slow is her Ult enemy can just walk away or atleast walk out of the middle of her Q to avoid damage. If they have dash then they can just dash away or dash behind her to avoid the damage when dealing damage to her. Well thats not sound like fun.

So we have a champ that dont have any form of cc, Only have a slow thats her Ult. Can only regen when hit champion and have a problem chasing down a runing away target. Not to mention that she have minor mana issues. Oh thats kinda not OK.

Now for the runes, item and matchup part.

# Runes

I have tried Conqueror, Grasp, HoB, Glacial and PTA. Here is the conclusion after a few game:

* Grasp: This make her short trade better, Bone Plating help with bursty matchup / Second Wind is so good vs poke lane it help u compensate the lack up regen in her kit.
* Conqueror: Q give only 2 stack. Thats mean u need to Qx2 + 4aa or Q + 5aa to have max stack Conqueror. Compare to Riven/Fiora/Irelia etc its so slowwwww. Even with atk reset + atk speed on E its still slow. So after 2-3 try i only take it into tank matchup.
* HoB: Great rune to manfight early game. Charge up your Q stack with minion. Go in and you can have 4 stack Q before Q are up again. But its kinda waste later when you have maxed E and Nashor's Tooth.
* PTA: Make you trade better early. Still good later in the game. By taking this rune you can also have Last Stand/Coup de Grace to increase your damage. PoM also solves her mana issues. But you dont have any regen so if you are behind you are done for.
* Glacial: Almost guarantee to hit Q if target dont have dash. Help u stick to slippery target with the slow and approach velocity speed. Approach velocity can also help u chase down target that are far away when hit your Ult. Biscuit and Free boost is also very very good.

What she need is something that can help her regen at laning phase and better dueling later. I feel like none of the rune i have mention above fit that except Grasp. But Grasp is just a OK choice, not great or perfectly suit Gwen play style because what she want a extended fight not short trade.

After all i dont find any rune that really suit her or best for her. Currently i just have to adjust to every matchup.

# Items

Starting item: Because Gwen have a problem with regen in lane so most of the time i start with D.Shield / Corruption Pot. Maybe i will try D.Blade later.

Mythic: Riftmaker / Everfrost / Frostfire Gauntlet

* Riftmaker: Give HP, Omnivamp to regen from minion, Increase damage and true damage. OK choice. The problem is that Riftmaker combine cost of 1050 gold. U have to build a Blasting wand thats 850 gold for 40 AP. 40 AP mean 6 - **ONLY 6** damage on-hit on E and 0.5% enemy max HP magic damage ( early game its \~ 4 damage on 800 HP target PRE mitigation )
* Everforst: Have a active that root/ slow target. Solves her mana issues. Give some HP and AH which is nice on Gwen. But no sustain and if u choose this u have to rely on rune for some sustain. And as mention above Conquer kinda only work with tank matchup and Ravenous Hunter is only 7.5% omni vamp at max stack. Not to mention that u have to kill or assit to stack it, thats mean early game u dont have any regen and because you dont have any cc or utility if you are behind its very hard to stack it.
* FFG: Basically Glacial with tanky stats and some damage. Despite dont have any regen the HP and Amor/ MR help her in the laning stage. Mythic that increase HP is OK too. This will be the best item for Gwen IF she deal damage base on HER % health instead of enemy. The problem with this item is it dont have AP that make stack AP slower, which make her damage much lower and her only have damage.

After tried some build i think no matter what you get, build defensive item first will make it easier for her.

Legendary item that have good winrate on her is Nashor's Tooth, Lichbane and Cosmic Drive. It give more %AP damage to compensate her low AP scaling. Movement speed to help her stick to her target.

No. I dont build Botrk + Kraken on Gwen. If i do that i'm gonna play Viego instead of Gwen. I think if we have a AP Stridebreaker it will be best item for Gwen.

# Matchup

I'm not gonna list all the matchup here. I'm just list some typical matchup of each champion class.

* Fiora/ Irelia/ Camille: They all have great mobility, Slow or Hard CC, Healthy trade pattern and safe way to regen back HP ( atleast safer than Gwen ). Fiora and Camille also have increase movement speed or a way to stick to their foes. Gwen just have a dash.

In Fiora matchup she can just use W to complete negate your Q or dodge it with her Q. She have 2 slow ability, can poke you with max range Q to regen. After 1 item ( or maybe she dont even need it ) she can just run you down when ever Ult is up and you cant escape because her Q have shorter cd.

In Camille matchup you almost never comeout on top with a trade.

With Irelia its a bit tricky, you can try to cheese her lvl 1 with E + Ignite. But if you let she reach 6 or complete Botrk and you dont have a major lead then its over. She will kill you every single time her ult is up. If you play safe then she gonna keep farming and zone you out to the point u are useless.

* Kennen / Kayle / Quinn: Its over when they reach 6.

Kennen just gonna poke you little by little until you dead. Because you dont have anyway to regen HP and you can even touch Kennen. By the time he get 6 its over. E in and R, voila you are dead.

Kayle is easier but when that thing get 6 its become kennen. Not to mention that Kayle have higher damage early than Kennen.

In Quinn matchup you can play safe to not get killed but the best outcome is not lose the lane. She can just E away then hit you to active her W passive when you waste your E. After that she can just roam non stop. Lets say after a push she roam mid and u clear the wave then follow. But she have a slow on E and much faster burst, not to mention that by the time you get there your teamate might be dead alr.

* Maokai / Sion / Shen: They have CC but have very low damage output or you can just dodge it with your E / W. They also build HP so your %HP is very good. This is the only matchup that in Gwen favor. But they just can help their teamate and let somebody else deal with you. You dont have any CC or utility to do so.

**TL;DR:**

Gwen have OK damage IMO but thats all she have. No Utility, no cc. If you fall behind, you stay behind.

Because of the AP item build its make it harder for Gwen to snowball the lead ( if she have ). She dont have any good rune or item build path. All she have is OK rune and item build.

Compare to other champ in her class - which is Skirmisher like Fiora/ Irelia she don't have slow or cc, cant regen from minion or have a safe way to regen, struggle to stick to enemy that run away and have a riskier trade pattern.

She have a hard time with enemy that have high damage output and can stick to her. Its really hard to not get runned down when they have a lead on Gwen

After all i feel like she just have a lackluster performance because Riot regret that they created Viego. They remove her old Ult ( which have cc ) and doesnt put any utility in her kit ( maybe removed it ? )

SO PLEASE. DONT BUFF HER DAMAGE. GIVE HER SOME UTILITY, CC OR ANYTHING NOT DAMAGE PLEASE !

**Give W a passive that make her gain movement speed when W not on CD ( Like Janna ) Thats all what i asked for !**

>!Or let her cast W like Kindred. It will open much more potential!<",2021-04-19 00:47:54,13.0,mtggq9

3r7tq4at,HardstuckPlasticV,"For those who haven't seen my previous posts, I'm working on a Ryze kit concept that pushes him out of pro play and brings back the ""battlemage"" playstyle / power fantasy that has faded in recent years (with the 9.12 changes as well as the S11 items). I am looking for feedback to improve it. 

I put all the context in my [FAQ post](https://www.reddit.com/user/HardstuckPlasticV/comments/mtlkqi/ryze_rework_faqs/); if you have questions/concerns, I might have addressed them there. 

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------

**TLDR:** Autos deal mana-scaling damage to minions. Basic ability mana scalings are removed. Ryze has a new passive, The Scroll, which stores damage to be converted into shields. The rune charge system is removed, but Q resets remain. W minion kills refund mana/health. Roots are EWQ. Autospread is removed, and WE spreads flux. The ultimate is restructured, granting a ramp-up movement speed passive and takedown-based warp activation.

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------

# Basic Attack

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 500.

\- PASSIVE: Auto-attacks deal an extra \[10 + 1.5% maximum mana\] damage to minions.

&#x200B;

\---------------------

# Passive: The Scroll

&#x200B;

\- Ryze stores 50% of post-mitigation damage from enemy Champions in The Scroll, up to \[15% max HP\]. Only damage to his health counts.

Overload casts drain \[5% max HP\] stored damage (if available) to give a 2-second shield for the same amount.

Overloads less than 2 seconds apart remove & refresh this shield.

Stored damage decays out of combat (full -> 0 in 15 seconds).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------

# Q: Overload

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 1000

\- CAST TIME: 0.2

\- COST: 40 mana

\- COOLDOWN: 6 seconds

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze unleashes a runic blast in the target direction, dealing magic damage to the first enemy struck.

&#x200B;

\- DAMAGE: \[80/110/140/170/200\] + \[65% AP\]

&#x200B;

\- PASSIVE: Ryze's other basic abilities reset Overload's cooldown.

&#x200B;

Interactions:

\- SPELL FLUX: If Overload hits a Spell Fluxed target (EQ), it repeats the the damage from Spell Flux, consumes the mark, and spreads to all nearby enemies marked with Spell Flux.

\- UNSTABLE FLUX: If Overload hits an Unstable Fluxed target (WQ), it instantly applies the remaining damage and consumes the mark.

\- PRISON FLUX: If Overload hits a Prison Fluxed target (EWQ), it instantly applies the remaining damage, roots the target for 1.75 seconds, and consumes the mark. Consecutive Prison Flux roots on a single target are 1.25 seconds. \[IMAGE UNDER W SECTION\]

&#x200B;

\------------------------

# W: Unstable Flux / Prison Flux	

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 500

\- CAST TIME: 0.2

\- COST: 40/55/70/85/100 mana

\- COOLDOWN:  9/8.5/8/7.5/7.

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze traps the target enemy, dealing them magic damage every 0.25 seconds over 1 second and slowing them by 40% + \[1% per 100 bonus mana, capped at 10%\] for the duration.  Minions below 25 HP are executed.

&#x200B;

\- TOTAL DAMAGE: \[60/80/100/120/140\] + \[60% AP\]

&#x200B;

PASSIVE: If Unstable Flux kills a minion, Ryze regenerates:

\[6-11 (based on level)\] mana every 0.5 seconds over 10 seconds, 120-220 total

\[2-5 (based on level)\] health every 0.5 seconds over 10 seconds, 40-100 total

NOTE: He can last-hit Unstable Fluxed minions with autos for the same effect.

&#x200B;

Interactions:

\- SPELL FLUX: Casting on Spell Flux (EW) creates ""Prison Flux"". This deals the same damage as Unstable Flux and grounds the target for 1 second instead of slowing. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\- DAMAGE: \[30 + 5-60 (based on level)\] + \[20% AP\]

&#x200B;

Interactions:

\- UNSTABLE FLUX: Spell Flux spreads when cast on Unstable Flux (WE). This consumes W, removing the slow and instantly applying the remaining damage. The flux spread damages all targets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\--------------------------

# R: Realm Warp

&#x200B;

\- PASSIVE: During combat with champions, basic abilities on-cast grant \[4 + 4% bonus mana\] movement speed for 4 seconds. This refreshes on subsequent casts and stacks up to 10 times (40 + 40% bonus mana). The scaling is capped at 1000 bonus mana (80 flat movement speed). 

Remaining stack duration is paused while Ryze is channeling Realm Warp. 

&#x200B;

\-----

\- PASSIVE: When Ryze gets a takedown on an enemy champion, he is granted a cast of Realm Warp for 20 seconds. This does not stack.

&#x200B;

\- RANGE: 1000 (minimum) / 3000 (maximum)

\- CAST TIME: None

\- COST: None

&#x200B;

\- ACTIVE: Ryze opens a 350-width portal on the ground at his current location and channels for 1.5 seconds. Upon successfully completing the channel, he will blink to the target location,  becoming rooted, disarmed, silenced, and untargetable for 0.75 seconds.

Ryze can move around and cast spells during this channel, which can be interrupted by both silencing and immobilizing effects.

So as I said, for the next game I was matched with that player (who first of course asked me to kill myself in the lobby) who decided to ruin the entire game by killing himself over and over (0/22 at 14minutes). I didn't say anything for the entire game, neither did my mates (4 premades) and just let him do his thing and just report him by the end.

qarar79,DasherVIP,"I see way too many people complain that she is useless trash so let me educate you:

1. Gwen is better as a counter pick to tanks. Especially stat sticks like mundo.

2. Gwen relies on your ability to zone properly. Using W just so its out of your enemys range. Your Q is better used defensively when stacked with an enemy. Using E to stay just in range and staying on top of your enemy. Do not chase with Q the first hits deal jack, just use E or auto attack.

3  Ultimate recast and E cooldown reduction proc out of anything you hit. Wards towers minions camps ect. 

4. Suprisingly, Gwen absolutely busts towers with E.

5. After the last hit of Q, you will hit 1 aa almost instandly.

6. The ultimate is very good, building lichbane before nashors is a way better choise for high damage ult bursts.

7. Do not play her mid. She offers practically nothing there, just play top or even jg.

Four questions:  
When an ability is recharging and they are given +20 ability haste; does it immediately reduce the ability's cooldown?  
 **or** 

When the ally is given +20 ability haste the added ability haste is applied after the ability is used again?  
**also**

When the 4 second duration of added ability haste is gone, does it immediately cause the abilities on cooldown to be 20 ability haste longer ?  
**or**

When the added ability haste is gone, it doesn't increase the cooldown of the ability until they use the abilities again.

I'm in a situation where I want to grind ranked games and find my real elo, but I know I can't play more than 3 games without tilting and giving up in the next games.   

I know I could reach way higher than my current elo if I just focushed in the game and ignored all the people who is playing with me, but I simply can't find the way to do that. I've reached a point where I'm just hardstucked because the games I get 1-2 bad players I just give up and stop even trying.

3p1e9yd9,Pityuu2,"Bit of a dummy question, I haven't played melee champs much before.

Example: I'm playing Jax, dueling a Nocturne. We engage in the most legendary duel of the century by arrow attacking each other to death while standing still. Problem is: Jax's model is much larger than Nocturne's, and all of my R, E, Tiamat have aerial effects that obstruct my view, so I can't see what the Nocturne is doing: which abilities did he use? Most importantly, when does he spellshield? I can easily lose the duel if he counters my E with his spellshield, but my odds are a lot better if I can shove my Q or W in his face after he uses spellshield and only deactivate my E afterwards.

The only thing I can do to telegraph what he is doing is to look at his mana bar in the left-upper corner, but that is obviously sub-optimal. Is there any solution to see more clearly what my opponents are doing? The above example is obviously simplified just to clearly explain the issue. It comes up all the time when I'm trying to stick to enemies with characters larger than them, and not being able to tell what they are up to leaves my outplayed in situations that would be in my favor if I could actually see their character, not just mine.

A number of dodgeable skillshots are telegraphed on the character but in no other way (see Caitlyn's Q) that I also miss sidestepping as my character just covers theirs.

Can I somehow tone down the skill effects of my own character to be transparent or just hard to see? I obvously know what I am using, the valuable information is to know what do the enemies use.

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"Gwen is supposed to be an Skirmishing Hyper-Carry that needs to play around her farm early game against champions who outstat her such as Garen or Mordekaiser.

She needs to play around that in order to become strong later on.

But.....

Why not just pick Jax then?

Not only does Jax have better itemization than Gwen does, but he also he BETTER tools to play around his mediocre early game.

He has an AOE Stun that blocks incoming damage, he has a Ward Jump, and a Ult that makes him more situationally tanky when activated.

With these abilities he can play around his early game by taking advantage with his situational abilities to prevent towerdives, and overall minigate oppression from the enemy top laner as he farms.

Gwen does not have this, not only because her sticking power is almost non-existant, and her main damage ability's range is not good enough to safely farm with but she only has one CC tool, which is her Ultimate, which even then it's only a slow that also goes on a high cooldown.

Meaning she can't even stomp her own lane once she gets going in a way, as her lane phase is already limiting compared to even Nasus and Kayle, both hypercarry top laners (Nasus is more of a mid game kind of guy but you get my point right?). .

This is even worse for her, because the Top Lane is known for being an island, meaning she can't influence other lanes as easily as someone like Vayne (An ADC) or Kassadin (A Midlaner), so she could only just splitpush, but oh wait, she can't stick onto her enemies anyway, meaning her 1v1 potential is reliant on her Ult and being fed, both of which isn't really something that players wished to only have since being Ult-Reliant on an ability with high CD feels bad to play as unless said champ has tricks up their sleeve like Malphite and Fiddlesticks (Which Gwen doesn't have).

So she can't play around her farm as well, she can't do much as a hyper carry, and she doesn't add anything that makes her more favorable compared to other Skirmishers aside from being an AP Top Lane Skirmisher (Which, while nice, due to her being limiting, you might as well pick Mordekaiser for his AP).

The thing she has other than that, is her true damage from her Q, which also self-stuns her unlike Tryndamere's E or Fioras Homing Dash.

Yeah, might as well play Jax instead of her if you are looking for someone like her.

bjxcn,SummerDash,"Before I get flamed. Hear me out. I've played 40 games of Gwen thus far in Plat ELO (I know. Its not diamond or higher but at least its not a normal!)

I've done multiple builds with her that involve Nashor's. Nashor's rush into Rift Maker. Rift Maker into Nashors. Nashors into Everfrost, Everfrost into Nashors. Frostfire into Nashors and Nashors into Frost Fire. NONE of these felt impactful getting Nashors that early.

On paper Nashor's sounds amazing on Gwen, On Hit Damage, Attack Speed, and AP. Every stat she needs right?

Sure if she was going to simply right click champions and ignore the rest of her Kit.  Nashor's Tooth gives 100 AP,  50% attack speed, and 15 Base +20% AP On Hit Damage.  You get 80% attack speed from your E and 10+ 15% AP On Hit Damage when its active and extra range.

For an extremely mobile fighter who's entire kit is tied to her passive interaction with her 2 Damage abilities; you'd think people would be building to abuse those two aspects more and not rushing an item that only focuses on the passive alone.

I genuinely think Nashor's rushed as it is on her(1st or second) is bad. She needs 3 stats for her kit to work. AP, HP, and Ability Haste. Whats felt the best so far has been Frostfire Gauntlet/Everfrost because she NEEDS a way to force people into long engagements. She's a fighter not a skirmisher. She wants longer trades and engagements to get multiple Q's and E's off. 2nd item can be Demonic Embrace OR Morellos. She needs HP/AP and these two give really good combat passives to give her an edge. 3rd item SHOULD always be Cosmic Drive. 40 Haste, HP, AP, and 25 Movement Speed is just too good on her. After that you can flex into tankier items such as Spirit Visage to get more healing out of your passive/conquerer OR anything with movement speed attached to it such as force of nature or dead man's plate.

With Q you're doing 6 instances of your passive rapidly after 4 basic attacks that's 10 instances of 1% +.8% AP Max HP Damage. Adding your R into the mix which deals 1-3-5 instances of your passive. For a total of 19 instances of your passive. With Haste, HP, and AP you'll be able to stay in fights longer to get multiple Q rotations out and just shred through people. Nashor is by no means at all a bad item, but 1st item on a champion with innate attack speed steroids AND limited survivability seems off.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Gwen needs to survive in combat to abuse her passive. Rushing purely attack speed does literally nothing for her except make you easier to blow up. Get some HP and AP and Haste.

11e1ml,Capek95,"So many people complain about AP bruiser itemization and there's a lot heated debates on this reddit. So I've been thinking, if we just implemented adaptive stats on certain items, would that not solve a lot of problems for many champs?

For example, Sterak's could be one of the contenders for it, giving access of steraks to ap champions can open up a new world for ap bruisers. And the argument of mages potentially abusing them isn't even really there, because all those items have different passive values for melee/ranged.

w9tsr,GoatsAndGlory,"Smal rant inc. TL-DR: Yone can leave Camilles ulti, its unfair and im pissed.

Its no secret that most new champs or reworks are overtuned. Then nerfed into the ground, and then they are still overtuned (yes im looking at you Akali). While this is extremely clear when just looking at the gameplay of champs like Akali, Irelia, Samira, Yone ect. Thats not really where it becomes a problem. Its the smal things. We had champs with insane mobility for a long time, and its been problematic at times sure. But not more then statchecking tanks or adcs abusing items not ment for them.

Now yone is particular dosent look as insane as akali irelia or samira with the number of dashes, because he mostly just runs at you in a straight line and ults you. But he is just as overtuned as them. He scales insanely well with items due to his passive. He has no mana. E is easely top 5 best basic abilities in the game, some say you can counterplay it by bursting him when he gets back, and then they proceed to get dove while yones body is still under his own turret. He deals mixed dmg so its hard to build defencive agains him. He is the only champ in the game so be classed as both an Assasin and a fighter and succesfully pull it off (rip dreams of drusior diana). He has the snowball potential of a Katarina on crack so a 0/5 yone can get one kill and then singlehandedly win the game from there. He has yasuos ulti but dosent need setup. He has 2 ways to cc you and with his dmg those 2 will usualy keep you cced untill you are dead if your squishy. And im not even sure if i have to mention the healing since grivious wounds is no longer an optional buy depening on what you face now a days. Its mandatory every game.

But, im not mad about all the shit yone can do. I dont really care anymore, its not because its ok. Its because we have been getting used to it over time. Like a frog sitting in water that is brought up to a boil. I guess its fine that yone is overtuned when u have a large handfull of champs that you can play agains him that are equaly overtuned. But the one  thing that tips the scale. The one thing that makes him the most overtuned champ in the game. HE CAN ESCAPE CAMILLES ULTI.                                                 And ye, i hear you. ""thats not the most busted thing in the game"". No, its not. You dont pick yone as a counter to camille because of this. It rarely ever matters. But the fact that he can makes me pissed. And it shows riot favoritism agains champs that are popular and sells more skins. And i dont mean popularity in getting more skins, i mean popularity in balancing. Camilles ulti is worded ""Cannot escape by any means"". And i remember when she came out and the community tested everything to get out of it. And riot stayed true to thier word. Nothing got out. Because she was the newest coolest champ. But then riot decided to release Yasuo 2.0 electric boogalo. And just like a guy who became the CEO of a company with the help of hard work, dedication, and a smal favor from his dad that owns the company. Yone was destined to become a fan favorit due to his similarities to yasuo, one of leagues most popular champs. And its ok if this is a bug and it gets fixed. But ive stopped giving riot the benefit of the doubt a while ago. The stupidest thing is, Camilles ulti is supose to be an absolute, as the wording says. ""CANNOT ESCAPE BY ANY MEANS"" whereas Yones e is not even an absolute itselfe. If he gets cced he will stay where he is insted of going back when the duration is over. Its not an unstoppable force vs an imovable object. Its just a new popular cool champ getting favoritism, most likely because he will sell more skins them Camille.

PS, if you think that it ""makes sense"" that he can leave because his body was never in the hexagon. Ekko goes back in time. Cassio can ulti malph, teemo can blind lee sin, ect ect.                                               And, yes i know the reason why Yone is destined to be popular is because he is a ""Weeb champ"" and ""Riot is pandering to ChInA"" but we all already know that and we cant do shit about it unless we all start to main and buy skins exlusivly for monster champs so :/",2021-04-19 10:11:45,3.0,mtqw7f

8zkah2kv,MadAtDisney_,"Some items are really strong right now, others not so much. But I feel like, without a doubt, no item needs a rework as much as Wardstone. 

I remember during the pre-season how supports compleined about this item. They painted out that it simply wasn't worth buying at all. But, of course, there was a lot of people calling those who complained ""low elos who knew nothing of the game"" and saying that ""surely it'll be a competitive item"".

Well, we're almost at MSI and I haven't seen a single support building it in competitive play. I mean, I don't watch every game of every league, but I always catch the LEC games and the games of my own region. Not to mention a game here and there from LCK, LPL and LCS. 

And in ranked, I only ever saw it once. They lost the game, so I'm assuming it wasn't very useful. And I'm talking about high plat and low diamond games, still low elo-ish, but where people have a vague idea of what wards are for. 

I also haven't seen it on any of high elo streams I watch. Overall, I don't have the statistics, but I think there's not a single soul out there building it right now.

The item sucks. Support economy is already hard. Right now Mystic is pretty much mandatory, they also increase the cost of AH boost. You need level 13 to purchase, so you cannot make use of that for a good part of the game, considering the games seems to be over really fast because of players mentality.

9dxqu,Xemidan,"**TL;WR: H5 reward, honourable skinline for all champs, pick one for favourite champion with H5 token, rip from account if dishonourable.**

**DISCLAIMER:** This post is not meant to be hating on free stuff through positive behaviour (positive behaviour imo should be a standard thing but that's besides the point). It's an idea to maybe 'modernise' / approach the 'honor' system with a different incentive to promote proper behaviour. Also, friendly banter or friendly trashtalking is a-okay. Being an actual ass isn't.

Since I've gotten the H5 token last year, I have yet to spend it on a chroma of the two skins. I figured: ""What if I keep my token and wait until Riot adds something that I *do* want to have?""

This lead me thinking to the good ol' idea that's been thrown out almost every time: The 'honour skin-line'.

A few years after the honour system was implemented, many people were unsatisfied or felt like the rewards reaped from being honourable was a bit...tame, to say the least. And whilst the idea of the honour system was to encourage positive behaviour, most of the time it ended merely being a free rewards system for those who are already on their best behaviour. Besides, the skins you get now from the honour system was an incentive based on how 'rare' those skins were considering they were from the good ol' ""Refer-a-Friend"" system. They had a meaning back then. But modern times require modern changes.

So what if Riot decided to make an entire honour skin-line for all the champions? Every champion gets an 'honourable skin"" and when people hit H5, they get to pick an honourable skin for the champion they main / one-trick / play a lot. Of course, this would mean the skin would have to be something that reeks of ""It's worth playing / getting this skin."" The Grey Warwick and Medieval Twitch can go into the legacy vault (they *did* leave a legacy after all).

Now I'm not saying it needs to be an ultimate, legendary or mythic skin-line (it probably would fall into the latter type), but it would feel like a slap to the face if it were to be of 750 quality. It needs to 'special'. Like how certain OTPs either use different skins or a skin that they really like using a lot (e.g. Rengar OTPs don't necessarily agree on one skin, nor do Rivens, Darius, etc.).

*""But what if people start becoming dishonourable after getting an honourable skin of their favourite champion?""* Just the usual repercussions and taking away their honourable skin. This would give meaning to the skin as well. You get to keep your honourable skin as long as you stay honourable. (I mean when your acc gets banned, you're losing your entire account with skins and champions and whatever you have).

This idea will probably take years to work on for Riot (considering the champion pool growth and the amount of skins they'd have to make and think of if they want to properly represent being honourable). But I do think it's worth it for the longevity of 'honourable behaviour'. Then again, I don't know how long League will keep on expanding. (#Deathflag)

Logically the answer should be no, Clash takes your MMR/ranking for ranked and I assume norms and uses it to work out your tier, combines it with your teammates and tosses you in a tier based on that. Furthermore losing I believe can reduce your tier if its repeated, so on the flip side it could be reducing things like Ranked MMR.

kw7zh,Farranor,"I played a match against Gwen (OFA) and spent basically the whole time asking my team how to even interact with her and I still don't understand. I see a teammate fight her in mid, and she goes untargetable. I figure, okay, I have to wait that out. But it turns out it lasts several seconds, and she can keep using abilities. Maybe I can avoid that area, like a Trundle W? Nope, she drags it along with her. So my team says you have to be inside the special area if you want to hit her. But you can't auto her, you have to hit her with a spell. Wait, you mean skillshots will hit her but I can't use anything targeted, like Akali's old ""obscure"" effect that got removed because it was bullshit? Well, no, Brand Q will go right through her. Okay, so... what do we do? I didn't have time to start poring over a guide, so that was basically it.

It shouldn't take more than a couple instances of a champ using an ability against you to at least see what it fundamentally does and what you're expected to do about it. I played an entire match against five Gwens and still don't have a clear idea how to even interact with her at all while she kills me. I understand her snip-snip skillshot and her dash. But that Shroud 2.0 is basically impossible to figure out within a game and requires looking up the ability (on the wiki, not the official site, of course) to have any chance of even knowing what the counterplay is supposed to be.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if that ability gets stripped down just like Shroud was, with compensation buffs elsewhere (apparently she's weak and will be buffed next patch).",2021-04-19 08:18:29,0.0,mtp0v0

I think for players who see mid lane as a carry lane, there's a lot to be desired in increasing diversity mid. It'd be worthwhile to look into reverting the mid lane changes from last season, waiting a few patches to see how that shakes things up, and then buffing assassin items.

However, the game just takes too much time of the day away. And it's not fun. I had several accounts in Diamond and Masters, but I don't enjoy the game. I feel numb to winning or losing. I have had dedicated hobbies in my life that basically disappeared from one day to the other. Watching wresting, watching one specific Youtuber or playing FIFA.

if this site has a reasonable degree of accuracy, and since it's been widely used for a long time I'd assume so, it looks to me that jungle isn't in fact a dead role or an autofill fiesta, it does alright instead.

At iron+, which means it counts everygame played on this patch that the api gives access to, jungle is the third most played role above supports and adc.

At silver+  it's the 4th, 0.3% less pickrate than ad and 1.1% more pickrate than support. 

At gold+ it's above supports and even with toplane and it keeps growing in pickrate all the way to masters while top becomes the least played role.

I honestly feel robbed by another 200 years champ, that does ton of true dmg and has insane healing, and people actually complain she needs buffs. Give me a break.

This is a full list of jungle champions that received sizable and sometimes careless nerfs over the course of the season. Maybe if Riot didn't turbonerf the pool in a very short time span, the competition would be there.
2. Reduced gold income- this concerns the competitive the most, where you do not have free kills lying around the map. Carry/Damage build requires continuous purchases of items to keep up with the game and continue putting out relevant damage. When you buff camps and reduce gold, income decreases naturally and the meta shifts towards junglers with good survivability and utility- same reason we had cinderhulk rek'sais and lee sins running around in S5. Tank items give them opportunity to still bring to the table utility and work as a meat shield.

P.S. What the changes didn't do is change which junglers are viable. Pace is and always will be the most important part of jungle, no matter how much Riot tries to force the Sejuanis and Zacs into viability by nerfing real jungle champions.

The champion pool doesn't change all that much. High pace is still essential, so you'll see Hecarim/Udyr/Olaf- style junglers dominate, as always and as it should be.

Yasuo has an aoe knockup extension that reduces armor against crit at an 80 second cd, tryndamere is undying for 5 seconds at 110 sec cd, Malphite has an unstoppable aoe knockup at 100 and ekko gets his full hp bar on top of massive dmg every 30 seconds.

59g1hd20,AssasSylas_Creed,"What is the point of this rune giving gold? Her cure already makes her the best option of the 3.

Let's do a brief reflection between the 3 options:

&#x200B;

Triumph will heal you whenever you kill an enemy and give you additional gold per kill, useful in TF, dives, etc.

///

Presence of Mind is used by champions who spend mana, in theory all champions who use mana and want to use Precision as their primary should use this rune right?

So why are there a ton of champions who use mana and prefer triumph?

The answer is simple, it does not pay to give up Triumph for PoM unless in specific cases of champions who spend tons of mana.

///

Overheal should be used by champions that have heal in the kit like Aatrox or champions that abuse life steal like Irelia.

But they don’t use it, to be honest I’ve never seen anyone use this rune on any champion.

///

Going back to PoM, we know that most of the champions that use mana probably make a mythical item of mana or are in the jungle where they don't have to worry about mana.

In this case, Lost Chapter already solves the mana problems of these champions and when the mythical item is ready PoM becomes irrelevant not only for the extra mana of the item but for the natural mana growth of the champions.

///

Returning to Overheal, the shield is good but Triumph gives you more healing which is everything a champion that already heals wants ...

There's not much to say here, I think.

///

Again, why does triumph give gold? Healing is enough to justify the use of the rune, this gold should be removed or transferred to one of the other two options.",2021-04-19 01:50:24,0.0,mtho5p

5wcpcto8,aaaa11212111,"tl;dr, Gwen is trash at this moment, and I don't see a way to make her shine just by buffing stats. She is a bad-designed champion.

First we take a look on ability, Q deals a lot of damage when 4 stacks AND hit in middle, E offers a slight dash and some on-hit damage & AS, W give you armor and MR (that protection outside circle effect is just meaningless as the circle itself is too big, and you can't tank for your teammates), and her R slows enemy by a little, deals a lot of damage if you land on the 3rd shot.

My experience is, Gwen is pretty okay on super early game like level 2 and 3, especially fighting weak bruisers and tanks. But she falls off too fast and soon become useless after 2 items.

Every champion have a role, you either be tank, bruisers, spilt pushers, or offering CC for team fight. But Gwen have nothing, no role. She die instantly in a team fight if you engage first or get caught, can't clean up smoothly as your Q needs to stack up and your E is so short range, same problem with her R as you need to hit something before pressing 2nd and 3rd R (a lot of the time you can't use 2nd and 3rd R because you just get kited), and also any spilt pushers 1v1 win you after 2-3 items, for example jax and camillie (and they perform way better than you in team fight). 

I feel like playing a nerfed Diana or something when I play this trash Gwen, and this is not a problem of low stats, it's just a problem from design. Probably need a rework before she is actually playable in high elo or pro games.",2021-04-19 02:45:02,7246.0,mtiqnw

kyed8,Nicki261,"Gwen has gotten a small hotfix buff already and she's been out for just a couple of days. This is the exact thing that has been happening for years on end with new champion releases and it doesn't seem to stop at all. So many champions get unneeded buffs after their release simply because they have a low winrate, ""the lowest ever winrate"" according to numerous sites that say the exact same stuff for every single champion release. 

Gwen is not a hard champion per-se, but she does take a bit of skill so it's fair to say that it will take a while for her to be truly understood by the community. Players are gonna feed on her because hey, what do you know, not everyone has a grasp of every single aspect of the kit in its entirety after ONE game. It's seriously annoying because she is fine as she is now, and she really has lots of room to win in a lot of matchups top, so it's mind boggling how we're still conditioned to think that her winrate being low is a product of her being weak, when it's simply the fact that people are still learning her. 

It doesn't make sense. Why don't we just wait for a couple of weeks before deciding if she's overtuned or underpowered? It's honestly insanity because this happens to every newly released champion. Remember Yuumi? The buffs she got cause she wss ""trash"" and ""the lowest winrate ever""? Yeah, well, guess who became so overpowered that they had to nerf her to the ground. Same thing with Aphelios, Yone, basically every champion on release. Why do they keep doing the same mistake over and over? Because if Gwen happens to be overtuned, then they're gonna nerf her to the ground and make her unplayable.

Can we please stop doing the same shit over and over and over again? It's starting to become stale and pointless.",2021-04-18 20:33:14,0.0,mtbz87

Yone right now gets a single item and heals back to full health off of practically every minion wave so he stays in lane forever until he eventually out-trades you since you have to back.

Old aatrox couldn't stay in lane forever since his W required getting basic attacks on minions off and Oldtrox didn't have a fast attack speed without items. Even with items oldtrox never really took over a game without the player themselves having good macro... similar to Master yi, Tryndamere, or Xin zhao.

4twcxstx,IreliasLapSitter,"Remove all assassins but 4 (Le blanc, Talon, Zed and Qiyana)

I don't even play assassins mages or mid in general but I'm was thinking why the game isn't really balanced. One of the things that for sure hold it back is how absurd assassins are.

Assassins are supposed to be high risk high reward. Then why do Ekko, Katarina, Fizz and Akali exist ? Ekko takes no skill, has 2 slows with one able to be a 2.25 sec stun (on an assassin) and arguably the strongest ult in the game. Katarina has 3 thousand blinks and while she takes skill to play properly, I wouldn't call her high risk. Zed is the same with his W but at least Zed can mostly assassinate 2 people unless extremely fed, and not an entire team...Three times. Akali also requires a lot of skill to play properly but you are never really risking anything unless you fuck up an all in. With her E and W there are almost no windows to actually punish her. Fizz like Ekko also takes no skill to play and with how low the CD of his E is (should have been like Vlad's W) he can't be punished. 

Diana and Sylas should be shifted away from being Burst mages-Ap assassins to being Ap bruisers. 

Mages could actually playing laning phase in mid without being utterly broken elsewhere or having extremely unbalanced items ( Zhonyas and Banshees being the best defensive items in the game while also giving 80 ability power). 

Tanks could have their damage lowered because the reason for tank damage being so high is for them to not be ignored during teamfights. Assassins are the only class that can easily ignore the front line and jump to the back line. 

And ADC's will for the first time not get oneshot by the 0/6 assassin when they are 1 item ahead because assassin damage.

AP bruiser items could also become a thing (Riftmaker is the sole Ap bruiser item right now) because there won't be champs not designed to buy the item that can abuse it. 

My reasoning for the four assassins that remain is:

Talon: Needs to play around his escape route and has nothing more than little invisibility (less than Vayne lmao great design).

Qiyana: Actually takes a lot of skill to pull off.

Leblanc: Complex combos and no versatility.

Zed: Also really difficult, needs to actually hit skillshot unlike Ekko, Fizz, Kata, Khazix, doesn't have aoe and you can easily counter his ult as he shows up behind you after the cast time so you have a lot of time to react.

For me the most balanced assassins in the game are Irelia and Camille with none of the two actually being assassins. They take a lot of skill to play, don't have get out of jail free cards and mostly in Irelia's case she needs a lot of skill and setup in order to do damage. 

Assassins should be high risk high reward but with champs like akali, kata and fizz there is little risk, khazix damage doesn't take any skill to dish out and also is hard to punish, and Ekko is just the worst designed champ in the game alongside Vayne in my opinion (that is a different discussion).",2021-04-18 19:33:24,3.0,mtb53d

Warning: Wall of text below

# Statistic

Usually by looking at stats and graphs you will see that items that arent meta and/or having low pickrate means they have high winrate. For example; Vigilant Wardstone has insanely low pickrate of 0.1% but holds a very high winrate of 64%, you will see similiarities in winrate and pickrate among other legendary items and some mythics, by looking at the first picture every item has a pickrate lower than 2% and winrate higher than 55% the reason behind this is those items are situational thats why their pickrates are low and they serve their only purpouse really good meaning they are much usefull cuz they are situational you cant buy them every game. For example Knight's Vow it provides damage reduction for your carries and it does it pretty good it has a good price decent stats and a very good active with a pretty decent build path, not to mention that you usually dont buy knight's Vow when behind  as either the carry of yours wont do much impact that buying this item wont be worth it due to your team losing, thats also why guardian angel has a 2.8% pickrate with 61% winrate because if you buy that item you bought it because your pressence in a fight is very important that you need to revive and fight on or escape (which is pretty unlikely). So you get the idea hopefully. Among 38 items on the pictures only 3 of them is mythics Shurelia Imperial Mandate and Divine Sunderer Shurelia holds a 54% winrate and remember what i said items that are lesser pickrate (2% or less) tend to have higher pickrate (55% or higher) which i explained above shurelia has a 54.2% winrate which we can slide it off and we are left with Imperlia and Divine Sunderer.

Imprelia mandate (Has TLDR)

As you know this item is a support item meaning it performs at its best when you always have allies nearby when in combat but it was also performing well with rylais (or built in slows and stuns) mixed with high ticks of damage (Aurelion Sol) since you could proc the extra damage on slows very often that it was good even when you were alone and because its a support item its price is low and solo laners can get this pretty fast it would also provide you with 15 ap per mythic so you wouldnt lose so much value in the late game so it got nerfed which is totaly normal as the item was being used the way riot didnt intended to and supports who use this item would just perform better with other support items such as pre 11.8 moonstone or 11.8 shurelia's or even or even Shield of the solari

**TLDR** about imperial: Was used by solo laners and got nerfed so they couldnt and supports who could use this had better options

And we are left with Divine Sunderer with a very very bad winrate of 51.0%

""Why?"" you might be asking it has low pickrate, is situational and havent got nerfed right?

Correct, the only change it got was spellblade wouldnt proc on turrets making you a turret slayer which isnt a major difference since you dont buy it to melt towers and the damage againts turrets was a little too much.

To find the reason behind this winrate lets look at the item itself the ones who use it and overall

40 Attack Damage

20 Ability Haste

400 Health

Builds from Phage Sheen and Kindlegem

Build path is ok nothing bad or crazy here

Mythic Passive Provides 5% armor Pen and 5% Magic Pen

Spellblade (I wont get much into numbers): After using an ability your next auto attack deals extra damage and deals extra damage to targets with higher MAX HP as bonus physical damage on-hit with minium Dealing 150% bAD  (for comprasion sheen passive deals 100% bAD) this max hp damage is capped againts monsters at 250% bAD and if the target is a champion you heal 5% of the targets maximum health and with minimum healing of 75% bAD

On paper it seems an ok item but lets do some maths

# Users

Hecarim Skarner Illaoi Nasus and Corki Senna and Ezreal for ranged (all these 3 have much better options corki has mixed damage armor pen and senna benefits better with kraken than divine sunderer not to mention the items performs worse when used by a ranged) are the ones that use this item more frequent so i took skarner for example

First of all when skarner buys divine sunderer he sacrifices his tankiness for damage but since his q has a pretty low cooldown he is good at procing it

# The math about the item

Lets Say you bought boots and Divine sunderer and an enemy bought chemtank/frostfire and tabis/mercs and both of you are level 9 a tank in that time and gold has roughly 150 armor and 1600 max Health without conditioning and overgrowth by 1 proc on that target your divine sunderer deals 71 damage and heals 91 Health per proc and you can easily proc it 8-10 times if you are 1v1 you have a dps of 150 and it took you 15 seconds to take the target down assuming that you are attacking a tank that wont slow, cripple root silence or stun you.Divine sunderer dealt 367 damage while healing you by 270 health

And lets say skarner hit twitch (one of the highest hp marksmen) Twitch has 1200 Hp and 50 armor at level 9 Divine Sunderer Deals 95 damage and heals 71 Hp on 1 proc and you proc it roughly 5-6 times which is alot considering you are fighting an adc and getting kited

Now lets compare that to a bami item, chemtank (which is probbaly what you always buy on skarner) and we are in a 1v1 scenario again and you fight 15 yet again and the result is you have 100\~ dps (the target had 120 MR as well which is unusally high because of practice tool) . Chemtanks burn damage dealt 191 damage and in this 15 second fight the target is left with lesser than 300 HP and lets compare the utility of these two items

# Comparssion

Any bami Item provides more tankiness

Divine Sunderer Provides sustain but needs you to auto attack in order to use it (not to mention GW exists)

Bami deals magic damage while sunderer deals physical

Chemtank active is waaaaay better than divine sunderer and also other bami items provide pretty good passives aswell compared to divine sunderer

Divine provides more damage (only againts tanks (again you need to auto attack them))

Bami items scale of off your max hp meaning more tanky you build more damage you will deal to enemies with these items

**TLDR**: The amount of utility bami items provide is much higher than Divine Sunderer and divine sunderer doesnt do the only thing its good about well to compensate

# Why it isnt preferable

Almost all of Divine sunderer users already have a anti tank ability in their kit such as skarner Q illaoi W Fiora Gangplank Gnar Jax Trundle Warwick cuz all of them either does not from divine sunderer, has a built in anti tank ability, or will not deal with tanks at all. Nasus is the only one that benefits by fullest from the Divine sunderer as nasus already has high damage againts squishies even then nasus has ap max hp damage in his ult, armor shred in his E and sustain in his passive Hecarim is the one pf the few who doesnt have a anti tank built in his kit but the utility he gets from chemtank is unmatched

&#x200B;

So what kind of change would you like to see or would you like to see a change at all do you agree with me or how would you change it. Excuse my english and let me know!

e51ey,TheLapricorn,"Like the title says, when Space Groove got added to the client I noticed that there was a source of music on my pc that I couldn't place. After a couple of hours I finally realized that it was the league client that was the source. Now I thought it was a bug and kept an eye on the reddit to see what was going on.   
But now with the Gwen release music it happened again, muting music doesn't do anything and the only way to mute the music is to mute SFX.

For context I typically turn of music or ambience sound sliders since in my experience they cause a lot of sound clutter.  So to avoid that I now have to completely mute league client sounds which is not ideal for queue pops and game invites.

I understand that the Groove and Gwen music is different from the client music and the need for there to be a different slider, but can we please make it so it isn't tied to the SFX slider?",2021-04-19 21:30:01,4.0,mu0msp

The lock-in screen starts and all good, someone is faster than me and wins mid, no problem, I'm going top then, BUT there's this Darius who says he won top (even when he clearly hasn't typed anything in the chat) so I already picked Yasuo and can't change Champ, I try to negotiate with him in cooperating in top lane, he doesn't accept, so I ask him ""Where do I go then?"" he doesn't respond. The match starts, I try going top since I don't have anywhere else to go, he immediately starts complaining, so I ask him again ""Where do I go?"" doesn't respond and decides to go to jungle instead. Jungle. I was demoralized at this point. Obviously, we lost because he not only just kept feeding the enemy, but he would also engage alone in a 1v3. The worst part is that he says ""People like you are ruining this community"" when he is the one that decides to play alone instead of actually playing the game as a team. We lost 17 minutes in, and he starts to say ""Report this guy, blah blah blah"". I know not all the people are like this, but that's why I would like to ask you guys, What am I supposed to do when I lost both lanes for my Champ?",2021-04-19 18:12:08,8.0,mtxgrv
8cxgqob1,Horror_Ad4838,"Twelve of world's leading LOL e-sport organizations have today come together to announce they have agreed to establish a new mid-week competition, the Super League, governed by its Founding Clubs.

T1, Gen.G, DK, G2,FNC,EDG,WE,RNG,IG,FPX,TES, and JDG have all joined as Founding Clubs.( I am a LPL fan, bite me!) It is anticipated that a further four clubs (JT, TSM,TL, C9) will join ahead of the inaugural season, which is intended to commence as soon as paracticable.

Going forward, the Founding Clubs look forward to holding discussions with Riot and Tencent to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for LOL e-sport as a whole. 

The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing LOL E-sport economic model. Further, for a number of years, the Founding Clubs have had the objective of improving the quality and intensity (can't say that about NA tbh) of existing LOL e-sport competitions throughout each season, and of creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis.

The pandemic has shown that a strategic vision and a sustainable commercial approach are required to enhance value and support for the benefit of the entire LOL E-sport pyramid. In recent months extensive dialogue has taken place with e-sport organizations owners regarding the future format of League competitions. The Founding Clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall League E-sport pyramid.

&#x200B;

The new annual tournament will provide significantly greater economic growth and support for League E-sport via a long-term commitment to uncapped solidarity payments which will grow in line with league revenues. These solidarity payments will be substantially higher than those generated by the current League E-sport competition and are expected to be in excess of $1 billion dollar during the course of the initial commitment period of the Clubs. In addition, the competition will be built on a sustainable financial foundation with all Founding Clubs signing up to a spending framework. In exchange of their commitment, Founding clubs will receive an amount of 350 million solely to support their infrastructure plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic.",2021-04-19 15:17:17,10.0,mtvapb

mwtfw,SilvertheHedgehoog,"We all know that the game has become so saturated with mobility that some champions cannot keep up, needing tons of movement or a mobility tool themselves to stay on even footing. But how do people actually want to adress the increase on mobility tools? Do you want to remove some of those tools or do you prefer adding more anti-mobility tools like Poppy's W for example?

I'm personally now leaning towards the latter option. Yes, having too much mobility creates champions who can feel unbearable because of their swiftness, but it's also what makes champions feel fluid and have outplay potential. How many people would, say for example, play Yasuo if he didn't have infinite dashes on E? He would feel rather sluggish and contradictory to his champion theme of being an agile skirmisher.

Mobility sets pace for a character. The less of it it has, the slower it feels, but you definitely want to give appropiate risk/reward for having both crazy mobility or none of it. Obviously people like having some mobility, because it gives freedom in movement, so I can only assume mobility creep exists as an answer to people enjoying that freedom. I don't want to ruin a character's smooth and agile feeling, that's why I think just introducing some more anti-mobility tools is the solution, because you can become the fun police to their dashes without ruining how the dashing champion plays out.

Again, what would you do to adress the problem?",2021-04-19 21:44:37,2.0,mu0wri

9wen6qa6,newChampIdea,"Menos has been living in Shurima for 100 years it is a vulture that eats everything he finds in order to survive on the harsh desert conditions. Every day is battle between it and the strongest monsters who hunt the same prey. What makes Menos different from the rest of the monsters is its ability to adapt and evolve.

Abilities:

Passive: Menos has the abilty to consume the dead bodies of champions enemy in order to evolve by gaining powers out of them. For example eating Rammus while make it grow spikes on its back giving it a low level Rammus W as a passive, if Menos then eats  Galio on top of that it will gain a small shield or he might gain Galio's passive.

Q: As an experinced predator Menos is able to adapt in its enviroment making itself invisible and completely silent, in order to find the best time to strike. He can move slowly while it is camouflaged

W: Menos strikes a powerfull attack with its beak stunning the enemy which gives it attack speed as it is the perfect opportunity to finish of the enemy.

E: Menos has the reflexes that helped it survive the most dangerous enviroments. When it feels that its prey is too much for it to handle he can jump backwards using his wings in order and flee. 

&#x200B;

R: Menos flies in the vast sky to search for pray, within 2 sec his is untargetable and the summoner must pick a target(not globaly), if time passes Menos loses patience and attacks the one who is closer to him. After picking a target the vulture dives from the grabing with its clues it pray drags him away for a mall distance and dilivers vicious  pecks.

&#x200B;

Appearance:

I imagine Menos with a head of a typical vulture, but I want its body to show the variety of monsters it has consumed. Menos can talk since it devoured humans in the past.

I tried my best to not include any recent champions like Viego or Gwen as I sincerely believe that they won't cut it, but who knows am i right.

Personally I am very excited for this game and I've been waiting for it's release or maybe even a mini news update about it since last year. Hopefully we'll get smtg about it soon in the near future.

Trust me when I say that this list was WAAAYY longer in the beginning, but I had to really narrow it down to who I deemed as the one that has high probability to be in the game. Some of the factors that I consider when picking these champions would be: popularity, appropriateness to the game, creature type (human, monster, etc etc) and probably how I envision them doing their combos in game.

War can change a man forever, watching your brothers die alongside you in combat.   There are no winners or losers in war, only victims. Every man they kill, has a family, a home, a story. Do you read them all? 

... Not every mans story is worth reading... Full of dull moments and memories of when they believed they were happy... 

Still, it must be interesting to see what led them to this moment no? All of them fighting over which god they worship. Why would they lay down their lives, for this?

... Interesting... I never saw it like that... would you care to find out why? ... Why they are on this field today? ... 

What do you mean?

... Follow me...

“ Fall back! “ Arturius yelled to his men, “Fall back and hold the hill!” It was no use. He had led his men right into a trap. His intel led him to believe there was a group of 200 men in the valley. They were wrong; 4 thousand men waiting for us to chase after their crew of 200, we never saw it coming. “To the hi-“ Arturius was abruptly cut off by an arrow that managed to make it through his thick steel armor. As he was laying there in a pool of his own blood slowly seeping away from him he wondered “Is this really the end... Why does it have to end like this...” His vision slowly fades black 

“... It doesn’t have to...” 

Arturius opened his eyes in a panic, seeing 2 figures standing in front of him. One, a woman as beautiful as a rose, glowing faintly. The other, a hooded man shrouded in a grey mist, underneath the hood he noticed the figures eyes glowing a deep amethyst purple. “Where am I?”

“My name is Evangeline, you are on your way to the light my child, what has brought you here before me today?” The woman answered

“I don’t know...” replied Arturius “ A war. Pointless and bloody. I had no reason to be fighting or leading my men there, we sought carnage and we found it.”

“... Do you crave more? ... More combat... More destruction...” The hooded figure asked

“No. Yes. I have the will to fight on, and end this brutal war once and for all. But, at the same time I crave peace. To save the lives of all those I have failed.”  said Arturius

“Then I shall give you a choice” the woman said, faintly smiling “I will bless your shield and give you the power of the holy light, the power to save those closest to you. You may join the light”

“... Or you may choose, to embrace your death. I shall make you a nightmare beyond comprehension, and curse your flail with the blood of Drak’Thu...”

“Which path will you choose?”
“Which path will you choose?”

Knights Path (Passive) - Upon unlocking his ultimate, Arturius can choose to either drop his flail and accept Envangelines blessing, empowering his shield and putting his faith in the light, or he can set down his shield, and accept the blood of Drak’Thu, cursing his flail and sealing his fate. 

Q (Might of the Knight) - Arturius swings his flail above his head, dealing 30/40/50/60/70 damage to nearby enemies, then he throws it in a straight line dragging it back to him dealing damage 85/100/115/130/145 when thrown, and on the return. 

Q (Evangelines Blessing) - Arturius slams down his shield, dealing 80/110/140/170/210 magic damage, and slowing nearby enemies, as well as granting him a shield increasing in strength per enemy hit with this ability. 

Q (Drak’Thu’s Curse) - Arturius swings his flail above his head, dealing 30/40/50/60/70 damage and slowing nearby enemies. He then sweeps his flail left to center, with a shadow of his flail sweeping right to center. The sweep does 75/105/135/175/205 damage on each side and slows, enemies caught in the center of both flails will be stunned for 1 second. 

W (Might of the Knight) - Arturius empowers the next 3 swings of his flail, the first attack slowing by 30% for 1.5 seconds, the second healing him for 50% of the damage dealt, and the third has 50 bonus range and always critically strikes, dealing 10% of the attacks damage as true damage.

W (Evangelines Blessing) - Arturius calls for the lights aid, empowering his next 3 auto attacks. The first, granting him 15 bonus armor and magic resist for 5 seconds, the second attack stunning the target for 1 second, and the third attack grants all nearby allies 30% increased movement speed decaying over 3 seconds. 

W (Drak’Thu’s Curse) - Arturius craves for bloodshed, empowering his next 3 auto attacks. The first attack deals bonus magic damage equal to 8% of the targets maximum hp, the second attack slows the target by 99% for 1 second, and the third attack always gains 100 bonus range and always critically strikes. Additionally, after landing the third attack all of Arturius’s basic abilities cooldowns are reduced by 2 seconds. 

E (Might of the Knight) - Arturius raises his shield, and after a short delay rushes forward. If this ability hits an enemy deal 90/110/130/150/200 magic damage, stunning them for 1 second, and reduce this abilities cooldown by 50% of its base value. 

E (Evangelines Blessing) - Arturius raises his shield, and after a short delay rushes forward. If this ability hits an enemy deal 90/110/130/150/200 magic damage, stunning them for 1 second, and reduce this abilities cooldown by 50% of its base value. If this ability hits terrain, Arturius breaks through it. Temporarily destroying a hole in the terrain until this ability is off cooldown.

E (Drak’thu’s Curse) - Arturius takes a step back before blinking to a target enemy, slamming his flail into his target dealing damage 50/70/90/110/130 - 90/120/150/180/210 based on the distance of the blink. This ability also grants Arturius 20% increased movement speed for 2 seconds after the blink is completed. 

R (Evangelines Blessing) - Arturius radiates a blinding light, blinding all nearby enemies for one second. For the next 10 seconds he is orbited by 5 shields, each absorbing 200/300/400 damage before they are broken. 

R (Drak’thu’s Curse) - Arturius swings his flail at a target champion, with a shadow of his flail targeting this champion. This ability may be cast 4 times after its initial cast, each time with one more shadow flail. Arturius regains 25% of the damage dealt with this ability as HP.",2021-04-19 20:42:17,0.0,mtzr3r

So, being a very early supporter of 100 Thieves and more specifically their LOL team, this was very pleasant news for me to hear as my doctor just recently told me that my copium was running out :)

Tonight I decided to check out Nisqy's twitter and see if he happened to be following any of the 100 Thieves members to give me some hopium to survive and I find some very promising evidence:

[https://imgur.com/gallery/hc9w1xe](https://imgur.com/gallery/hc9w1xe)

It looks as if Nisqy is following every single member of 100 Thieves related to their league of legends team. Not only is he following all of their main LCS team players, but also all of 100T's academy players, and even some of their less widely known/followed members like their assistant coaching staff (Joseph Jang and Freeze) and even Celina Wang who is their esports operations manager.

Obviously this is obviously all just speculation but all I'm saying is Nisqy is following less than 700 people on twitter and I don't believe he goes around following any esports operations manager from most esports organisations. 

The purpose of this post was just to get some discussion up and going and hopefully give some hope to my fellow 100 Thieves fans who've been struggling for the past couple years :)",2021-04-19 18:45:45,2.0,mtxxnr

First of all I want to say that this is not just me, but many more Azir OTPs, streamers and mains think similarly to me.

In a meta where champions that take half or more of your life in a single trade are normal, I cant understand how is that Azir exists, a champion that does less than half the damage of meta champions and that requires 10 times the experience and even with all that he gets nerfed... 

I know that the nerfs where because of pro play, but I dont get payed for my games, and neither my team mates, and my team does not make detailed strategies or plans of how to play around me, most of them have never played with an Azir on the team before.

Azir used to be a specially strong in late game, but now that everybody is strong during late game, and most of meta champions are strong through all the match (early, mid and late) it makes no sence to use a late game champion... And even less one that is so hard to master... Unless you already spent hundreds of hours learning the champ...  
I think that Azir has been degraded to an ult and turret bot, in pro play that works because your team mates know how to react, but not in rankeds...

3hiupp7x,helltoken,"TL;DR, wouldn't it already lower the chance of toxic behavior if we connect punishments across accounts? Surely this tech already exists, since I can make multiple accounts using the same email, so why not have XxFioraMaster69xX@<emailaddress>.com face punishments for being toxic on their alternate account, and have those punishments extend to their other linked accounts as well? At least then they would be slightly incentivized to play less toxic or go through even more trouble to separate these accounts. And when they're suspended on one account, they're suspended on their other ones too. We've seen them do this with T1 in the past, why not find a way to apply it to everyone?

Context:

In EUW I'm Gold 3, and hardstuck admittedly so, but a lot of the games I play are impacted by common smurf behavior. Before the whole ""play better"" argument get's brought up, I want to highlight some experiences in High Silver - Low Plat MMR games with smurfs.

Firstly, smurfs are extremely cointoss. They almost always fall into one or more of the following categories:- Experiment with matchups- Want to reexperience the grind- Get better at a specific (set of) champ/s- Just want easier games / Lower queue times- Wanna stroke their ego.

The people in my elo that have the highest propensity of just deciding the game is over, going afk, raging, refusing to group and play along, fall most often into the latter three categories and are 80% of the time smurfs. They really have no incentive to tryhard because they're already much higher elo on their mains. They also care little about getting punished for toxicity because they just play regularly on their main (or another smurf acc) as if nothing happened. They play most often with an entitled attitude and blame us for being bad, regardless of how they're playing.

I personally find it difficult to recognize a smurf/second account both on your or the enemy's team, even with [op.gg](https://op.gg). Winrates don't always show the whole story, because someone with 200 games and a 50% winrate could actually be a smurf just trying out stuff on that account. I adapt the best I can, but it doesn't just affect me: it affects my other teammates, and their reaction to getting smurfed on can sometimes also be the catalyst to coinflip attitudes.

Higher elo players instinctively know what to do better than others, but it get's really toxic when those same players expect that same level of knowledge from us. The ranked growth progression curve, where as players increase in MMR they would  need to adapt their playstyle to progress further, has a MASSIVE spike between high silver - low plat, because the elo is riddled with higher elo players you will inevitably match against. Instead of low silver players needing to be better than other low silvers, you suddenly need to be better than diamond players just to be ""consistent"". it's not a curve, its a spike with a plateau. Unfortunately, bad attitude smurfs are very much rampant in this elo, and their attitudes often times impacts game experience (muting all doesn't stop them from refusing to play alongside the team or them going afk).

Smurfs obviously harm the ecosystem for the largest pack of players. But Riot will forever refuse to deal with smurfs appropriately because smurfing is a massive income stream as players will most likely invest money into buying the right champions (and maybe even repurchase skins) for their account. It's so easy to create a smurf too, either you just buy a specifically levelled/mmr matched account and attach it to an already in-use email account, or you literally just create a new account (even with the same email). it's not at all difficult for players to smurf, nor do smurfs get punished aggressively enough to do so. I suppose that if we want to at least allow smurfs, it should at least be managed a bit. Smurf Queue doesn't solve the inherent problems, in my opinion.

The above was a little bit of a rant, but I wanted to suggest a feature request as well, where perhaps accounts connected to the same email addresses share punishments. That way if XxFioraMaster69xX@<emailaddress>.com went afk on their smurf account because they weren't winning the matchup or w.e., they get chat restricted or something on their main account. It would at the very least force players to take the games just a bit more seriously to where they can't just stroke their egos and leave when that doesn't happen.  


EDIT: some people are saying ""just make a new email address"". There are plenty of studies that suggest that if something becomes harder to do people will be less incentivized to do it. Creating and remembering a new email address over and over again is an added step to the process, and its why console games have significantly less smurfs. Additionally, it satisfies Riot's income stream by having users not be able to revert to another linked account and therefore be forced to pay more to set up a new account to continue playing. There's never a win-all solution, but it helps",2021-04-19 19:17:04,0.0,mtye14

&#x200B;

I dont know if Riot ninjas do really check this subreddit or not but when I heard that Gwen was gonna be a seamstress, I just thought ""wow cool we gonna sew the enemies to each other?"". Then I saw her abilties and... did Riot really lose their charm and original ideas?

For real, how could they not think about making her R some sort of Yuumi's Q, where you get to go past enemies with a big ass needle and make like a knot. For example, you throw the needle and control it for a bit, going through 3 enemies, then before the needle expires or something, you activate the R again, and by doing so, the needle becomes one end of the knot, Gwen would be the other end, and there would be an effect like pulling both sides of the knot, putting together all the enemies affected by the needle in one place, sort of like Ori's R.

Yeah I know that this idea can be a bit OP, and it would need a couple of nerfs here and there. But come on they just gave her some kind of Rell's Q that you can activate 3 times. Imo, Riot doesn't think too much about new ideas, and they are wasting a lot of potential on new champs.

9s5fjvin,HorrowLP,"Why these two? Simple.

**Everfrost**: It gives Gwen something he desperately wants. Like absolutely no discussion, she NEEDS it. A way to make someone stay still. Everfrost is the only item in the game that offers such a thing. Why is this important? Because it allows her to not miss with the True damage portion of her Q, which  is basically a large chunk of her burst/DPS. If someone can move, they can very easily get out of the center line due to how narrow it is. However with Everfrost's  easy to land Root, Gwen can now always guarantee to land the True Damage portion of her Q without needing to rely on someone else to use Hard CC.

**Press the Attack**: Why this rune? At first glance, Conq seems like a no brainer, right? She's a melee champion with an AS steroid. Meaning she can really quickly stack it. And this is actually some sound logic. However the reason this ends up not being good for her, is because her AP Ratios overall are just ass. You can stack conq, but the adaptive damage you're getting from it is less important and useful on her compared to someone else. PTA however, synergizes with her kit. Nashor's is a must have item for her and her E applies more on hit damage. Not to mention her Passive itself also gives Gwen another source of On Hit damage.

With all this on hit damage in Gwen's kit, the best way to really get the most out of it is through the damage amplification from PTA. Which just like Conq, she can EASILY stack it from her E's AS steroid. Now suddenly her passive is doing more damage. Her Nashor is doing more damage. Her E is doing more damage. Its actually crazy how much Gwen gets out of this easy to stack rune.

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"Maybe as a small bit, but never as a main reason at all.

Like more often than not, still like visuals, audio, personality, and preference in what a character has outside of gameplay do not play a part in their popularity. Heck even skill floor difficulty isn't even a huge issue to someone's unpopularity in-of-itself, just the small bits around it that acutally make a difference.

Why?

Well Akali is considered one of the most hardest champs to ever play in the entire game, and yet she is still popular in general compared to someone like Gangplank or Azir, because her payoff skyrockets once you become good with her, as she has man ways to weave in and out around her kit.

Same goes with Yasuo and Lee Sin.

Having a dislikable personality is not much either, because most of a champs popularity is determined with their kit, not their visuals or outlook on their design.

I mean for goodness sake, Seraphine is still popular and it isn't just because of the whole ""E-girl"" stereotype.

Also monster designs..... I still see people around other subs and here that actually think that's a good indicator for unpopularity.

&#x200B;

Seriously, it's not.

It just sounds convenient that it is because a good amount of said unpopular champs are monster designs, and yet those champs have more to do with their kit (Such as Skarners spires, Kog'maws lack of Agency compared to other Hypercarries, Kindreds Mark mechanic, Rek'sai's lack of vision from burrow and being too feast or famine, and etc).

&#x200B;

So yeah, popularity is most, if not, maybe even all determined by their kit, and nothing else.

I was initially not against the changes because I don't dodge games but last month my hamster Teemo nibbled the Ethernet cable while I was in champ select and I accidentally quit the lobby.

Because my account had been flagged ""OTP"" by the new anti ""NA Challenger"" A.I. I was immediately put into Dodger's Queue with all the other serial dodgers and my OTP pick disabled. Since then, I have been put into over 4000 lobbies without ever loading into a game as players dodge over and over from people either op.gg'ing MMR and winrates or not liking the comps. My client bugged out after the first 25 queue pops and now the ""quit"" and ""decline"" buttons don't even load anymore. The social panel is greyed out so I can't even chat for help. If I quit the client the system will flag me as a Dodger² and I don't want that. I can't.

djtpp,youturnet,"As a community we should re-visit honor and honor rewards.  I logged in today to finally hit the last honor progress before honor 4 (I do not think there is a way to check progress).  I got a honor 3 orb, opened it up and got a mediocre champion shard and not even a keys worth of fragments.  For how long it takes to increase honor level this is just a negligible reward.  I do not even want to talk about the terrible rewards for hitting honor level 5 at the end of the season.

Rewarding honor levels is currently a failed system.

Here is what I propose.

* Show honor level progress, maybe under the experience bar so that people actually acknowledge the honor level exists.
* Make meaningful rewards for achieving levels of honor, I am thinking something along the lines of the victorious skin line.
* Make honor rewards something people feel they would absolutely miss out on if they have poor behavior.
* Add a small token modifier for events for people with higher honor ie, honor level 4 players earn 10% more event tokens.
* Make honor level more fluid, I play fairly often and barely hit honor level 5 by the end of a season.  This goes both ways, honor level should drop faster as well.

TLDR: Make honor meaningful, because it never has been since its inception.",2021-04-25 23:32:07,7346.0,myamn3

IWD conversation with Wickd:     
   

>  The point is because TOP/MID/ADC are laning they actually don’t know what the fuck is going on in other lanes for the most part, so they just blame the jungler for a play going wrong with limited knowledge of what happened.  People don’t understand the capabilities of the role.

>  Let's be honest.

>  Due to junglers focusing intensely on PVE'ing they mostly don't know what the fuck is going on in lanes either.

>  The reality of the situation is that everyone knows Jungle is broken right now. Therefore a lot of extra unwarranted blame also hits the jungler.

Source: Tabe's weibo via @cutebchu https://twitter.com/cutebchu/status/1386300029309263873

RNG announces Coach Tabe can’t come to Iceland, because his passport has expired.

Tabe is from Hong Kong, so he must come back to Hong Kong, and spends 28 days for quarantine.

For the replacement, the postal service needs 20-30 working days, so Tabe will coach the team online.

For quarantine, Tabe needs to spends 14 days in Hong Kong while he also spends 14 days in Shanghai.

Tabe explained why he didn’t come back to Hong Kong to renew his passport:

1. He can renew his passport in Hong Kong Economics and Trade Office in Shanghai, but unfortunately it was Easter holiday during 1st April to 6th April, and the Shanghai office was off.

2. If he came back to Hong Kong for quarantine, and then renewed his passport, he wouldn’t attend the playoffs series.

3. For MSI preparations, he will coach the team online with drafts and daily training.",2021-04-26 08:03:11,431.0,myl29w

I know it gives ap when you buy more items, but it takes time. IMO it should at least have 75 AP if not more.

skgcvh4,Sibbe22,"Hello summoners,

I am a fiddlesticks D1 one-trick. I don't abuse dodging, i actualy almost never dodge a game. I'm one of those people who are to lazy to look up OP.GG or think about good teamcompositions. I know i can probably climb more if i do, but i just don't do it.

I try to hear all the different people who are telling there side of why dodging should be punished, or why it shouldn't. Today i saw a clip of doublelift saying that one-tricks should be punished in someway (by losing LP) for dodging games, because they should be able to play different champs or different roles.

For me, this is how a game goes when fiddlesticks is banned. First i lock in my infamous nunu. I actualy have a decent winrate on him, and i know how to play him well enough to win games even in high elo. But the amount of flame i get from my team in the games i do this, is insane. People are actualy flaming me for not dodging, or when i make 1 mistake they just trow the: 'you cant play another champion then fiddle' argument.

So i think thats the thing people are missing, as a one-trick you are even getting presured into dodging games by your teammates. If you dont, you choose to get griefed or flamed the entire game.

My point is, riot should first think deeply abbout what they want to accomplish with dodging punishment, and what should be considerd griefing, before they make decisions!

Have fun on the rift!

gnexa,Macaulyn,"So, last year, Riot decided to remove Oracle's Extract from the Howling Abyss map, replacing it with a similar effect carried by cannon minions, which wasn't a very popular change among ARAM players. Now, whether that should be reverted or not isn't what I'm going to discuss here, my problem is: how the hell did Riot think that change was what this mode needed? ARAM has some things that are either annoying or, in one case, actually problematic to the gameplay. Here are the things I thought about:

**Delayed sound effect from the health relic**

This is the one that causes gameplay issues and I had expected it to be fixed with the VFX update that happened recently. When a health relic is touched by a champion away from your ""hearing range"", the VFX will happen as usual, but once you're close enough to it that you're supposed to hear it, the sound effect will not start from a point that is aligned with the animation, but instead, will start from the beginning, and will not match the heal's animation, meaning that the heal will happen and the sound effect will continue afterwards.

That is very problematic, because the sound effect is usually what leads you to pay attention to those relics if you have your eyes elsewhere, what if you need that extra health and mana and need to change position to, maybe, a less favorable one, taking a risk to get the recovery and fight back. Well, if the heal already happened, you just moved into danger and didn't get it, you're now screwed, since you're out of position. I'm pretty sure this has happened ever since the health relic has been a thing, so it baffles me how it wasn't fixed yet.

**Pathfinding leading players through health relics**

To those who don't know, pathfinding is basically what leads you from one place to another when you click on the map, and it has to be coded in a way that will not have the character stuck in stupid places, that is how, when you click on another lane you don't get stuck in a jungle wall. Why then, in ARAM, does pathfinding lead me straight through health relics?

Here is a common scenario, it happened to me and I've seen happening to a lot of people: you respawn in your base, there is a fight far away from you, you click in it so you can go to it. You were paying attention to your allies in action instead of looking at yourself walking, but it turns out you walked through all the health relics in your team's side of the map... while at full health, because you were watching the action and pathfinding led you though health relics at full health.

**Relic icons on map without relics being available**

This is very basic and it also has been a thing ever since health relics were implemented: you look at the map, it shows there is a relic there, but when you go to it, its not there, and the map still shows it there, even though you have vision of it and maybe had it for quite a while.

**Disconnects at the beginning of the match**

Now, this seems like a normal problem, sometimes people just disconnect, right? Not in the way it happens in Howling Abyss. It always happens early in the match, there is someone disconnected and ends up reconnecting around 3 to 5 minutes later, it happened to me a few times, got kicked out of the loading screen for no reason and had to reconnect. Happens way too much, almost every match. I don't think I need to tell people why disconnects are an issue, so lets move on.

**Outdated champion selection**

Do tell me, why do we need to start with a champion, then re-roll them if we don't want it or if we want to give an ally another option? I've seen people suggest that we should have a few seconds to get a champion back when we roll a champion, so we give an option to an ally without risking giving up our own, but here is a better idea: start the selection already with one additional option per player, so we know exactly what is there and don't even have to give up? Why click a re-roll button, just add 5 champions to that upper bar from the start, that way we can keep the ones we start with if we want and people will have more choices.

**ARAM buffs/nerfs not mentioned in champion select**

So, basically, every champion has some extra changes in ARAM: they can deal or take more or less damage or their damage to minions is reduced (don't remember if there are more changes), but you only find out what changes in your champion once you picked them. Why? This is a really important detail for players to know when deciding which champion to pick, if they should re-roll or get another from the already rolled ones. It should be disclosed at the select screen.

**In conclusion...**

I have no idea why Riot decided to mess with the non-issue that was Oracle's Extract, but somehow missed those glaring issues and neglected to add quality of life changes. Like, I understand them not bothering to change champion select (its stupid, but I can see why they wouldn't bother), but the health relics stuff has been around for ages and it hasn't been fixed yet, and the disconnects are still a thing. A VFX update was nice, I know the team who did it apparently did it as a passion project, so its great to see those things updated, but some of them are still not functioning right, and others could be modernized.

msck9gu,jeffwingerisgay49,"It's not really a secret that Aurelion Sol is incredibly unpopular. Ever since being released he hasn't had that large of a player base, and while he isn't incredibly underpowered, his learning curve is so steep that when you begin playing him he feels useless and when you have spent dozens of hours on him he feels incredibly powerful yet still clunky.  

The biggest issue with Aurelion Sol is that he feels clunky and uncomfortable to play. He's not a weak champ by any means, but his unusual playstyle makes him unappealing to new players while one-tricks abuse the champ because of his high damage and roam potential. I want to make a rework that makes him feel more impactful when making plays while not increasing his damage across the board.

&#x200B;

**Passive: Center of the Universe**  

**NEW EFFECT:** Aurelion Sol's stars are inactive while in brush.  

**INNATE:** **Aurelion Sol** is constantly orbited by three *Stars*, each doing a full circumference in 5.25 seconds, and beyond them exists an Outer Limit affecting his damaging abilities.  

Each *Star* deals 12 − 120 (based on level)  (+ 30% AP) magic damage to enemies that come into contact with them as well as executes enemy minions that have less than 25 health, including if they are brought to or below that threshold.  

(One of A-Sols really weird features is that his stars are visible when he is in brush, by cleaning this up by making them inactive while in brush, he cant abuse the damage of them from cover while still allowing him to set up ganks and invades without giving himself away)

&#x200B;

**Q: Starsurge**  

**NEW RECAST:**  **Aurelion Sol** detonates the core, dealing magic damage to enemies within the area increased by 0% to 200% based on distance traveled.  

**REMOVED:** Stun no longer scales with distance, but instead is a flat stun of 1s.  

**Aurelion Sol** fires the core of a newborn star in the target direction, which expands as long as it remains within the Outer Limit and grants him 10% **bonus** movement speed while active. *Starsurge* can be recast after 0.25 seconds while the star is active, and does so automatically when the star travels beyond the Outer Limit.  

(The increased stun duration feels really nice, but aurelion sol does not feel as impactful when you hit an enemy with a Q the size of the lane and it only does a fraction of their health. Increasing the damage while lowering the CC should help his damage feel more fluid while not giving him burst with a lot of time to follow up)

&#x200B;

**W: Celestial Expansion**  

**REMOVED PASSIVE:** The stars base damage is increased by  + 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25.  

**NEW TOGGLE:**  **Aurelion Sol** pushes his stars out to the Outer Limit and increases their total damage by 30%. While active, Aurelion Sol gains 5% movement speed per second (maxing out at 25% movement speed).  

Mana cost changed to 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 from 40 + 22 / 24 / 26 / 28 / 30 per second.  

(Of course I have to bring the toggle back. Everyone wants the toggle back. I removed the bonus damage and gave him ramping movement speed to make up for the decreased bonus movement speed on his new Q, while reducing the increased damage to keep his Q damage in check)  

&#x200B;

**E: Comet of Legend**  

**ACTIVE:** **Aurelion Sol** pulls in his Stars and takes flight, dashing in the target direction. While in flight, **Aurelion Sol** has unobstructed vision and sets his movement speed to a static amount. *Comet of Legend* can be recast after 1.5 seconds during the dash.  

(I kept his E the same because there isn't much I would change outside maybe some cooldown or range changes?)  

&#x200B;

**Ultimate: Voice of Light**

**NEW PASSIVE: Aurelion Sol** gains 1 / 2 / 3 stars to his orbit.  

**ACTIVE:** **Aurelion Sol** exhales a wave of star fire in the target direction, granting sight of the area for 2 seconds from the start of the cast time, dealing magic damage to enemies within its path, slowing them for 2 seconds and, if they are within the Outer Limit, stunning them for 0.125 seconds and knocking them back to it.  

(The passive is really the only addition that might be too much. Aurelion Sol does scale well. And he does do damage. But by adding more stars to the orbit, while decreasing the damage per star, it can help make him feel less clunky by managing his orbit while not completely sacrificing his burst damage.

8g1fdios,Ir4qL0bster,"I’ll start. My favorite champ is shaco. He isn’t the best pick atm, nor was he since a long time. But what you can do when you play him atleast ok is the Most funny shit ever. 

For example, I like to play him AP as supp when the enemy picks an assassin as mid or jungle. Normally the assassin camps bot after hitting 6 and that’s where the fun Beginns. You just sit in the bush, hit that R and see the Zed ult your clone. With the stun followed your ADC (or you) can easily kill him. After that you let shaco laugh. It’s like good trolling. 

Shaco isn’t a pick that can carry (mostly) but it’s perfect to tilt the enemy carry to a level where they absolutely loose their minds and throw the game. I think that’s what shaco is designed for.",2021-04-26 16:19:21,5.0,myst4w

bclq7rt,ohmisbeleiver,"So I was playing as Zed mid and our team consisted of me (Zed) mid, Lucian top, Ornn jungle, Samira ADC, and Neeko support. Meanwhile the enemy team consists of Aatrox top, LeBlanc mid, Xayah ADC, Shaco support, and Master Yi jungle. 



Top lane was winning over Aatrox as the poke and kite-ing where too much for him to handle. Bottom lane was also winning as their shaco support wasn’t doing too hot. And I was dominating mid lane as this Leblanc didn’t seem to know their champion very well which is fine. Yi got a couple ganks off early game top and bot lane which resulted in him with 5 kills before 15 minutes. Our Ornn jungle was doing pretty bad. Before we knew it, the Yi was literally killing our entire team with one or two shots. The Yi was dominating everyone. Near the middle and end of the game it felt like a Zed vs Yi game as I could essentially one shot everyone on his team, including him, and he could do the same to me and my team as we both got pretty fed. 



Master Yi kept dodging every feeble attempt that our Neeko had at solo ulting him by Alpha Striking her and almost every time I ulted him, he would start meditating. Our Lucian’s ult did nothing as Yi would ult and run towards him till he was in Alpha Strike range then one shot him. 



The game resulted in a loss for our team with me ending up with 29/11/1 and Master Yi with a 37/6/3 and 63k damage in an essentially 38 minute match. I couldn’t carry our team to a victory as he shredded through us all. What am I supposed to do in that situation?

To me though, being a onetrick isn't that bad, and much better then just playing whichever champion is broken in the current meta. 

Which one do you think results in the lower skill player? People who just dodge if their champ is banned/countered or who can only play 53% win rate champs?

4gbiq27p,Old-Customer6752,"A new strat i have been having success with is using champs that have high controll over the lane early like Gp, lucian, irelia, quinn and rumble and setting up a cheater recall with futures market.

 On gp and lucian if you only miss about 1 minion of the 3 first waves you can buy sheen which is huge keep in mind this is toplane so you will have a bit less if you do it mid. 

On rumble i have moslty gone dark seal boots, but you can get hextech alternator if you start with amp tome, but this is risky. 

Quinn i mostly start refillable potion and long sword and buy vamp septer, but if you perfect and wait a bit i think you can get a dirk.

 I have tried this with garen, tham and trynd starting boots and rejuvenation bead and 1 pot and backing for berseker greaves but you have to wait in base and sell the rejuvenation bead so dosent feel worth it. The wave controll is not that great on these champs as well

11yyoc,AksysCore,"First off, I know some people love TFT, but don't you think it's better for both games if TFT had its own separate launcher on PC?

Then we can have a separate ""Rotating Game Mode"" option and ""Event Game Mode"" option in the client.

Rotating Game Mode will feature game modes that strictly rotate into the next game mode every two weeks. RGM will have the following games on rotation featuring a different location in Runeterra each time. 

• Nexus Blitz (Ionia)

• Crystal Scar: Ascention (Shurima)

• Twisted Treeline (Shadow Isles)

• Howling Abyss: Legend of the Poro King (Freljord)

• + other game modes that feature other places in Runeterra

URF, ARURF, and other similar game modes will be transferred to the ""Event Game Mode"" and this mode will have no strict rotation schedule.

Would players really care if the RGMs barely have any tedious balancing? How about just throwing in some general rules like ARAM on Wild Rift and call it a day?

Old League was crazy and fun. They'd launch wacky game modes to lure in players. It was creative and a nice break from Ranked. I loved it. 

Nowadays I can't help but feel they're turning into... I dunno, B-izz-rd? The new releases seemed too... Calculated. Methodical. Sales-driven. The fun level of the game has been totally toned down in exchange for the big bucks. Quality content, maybe, but too by-the-books.

x97im,zeus043,"Look, I'm a college student, right? I have a lot of time on my hands (this is a busy semester though), a little bit of cash but am mostly broke, but I still enjoy having all the skins for the champs I like. Like Leona. I bought the pass, played religiously for the past few weeks and I still had to drop another $40 to get the skin. I realize there were still a few days left to play, but this is just causing burnout for me. I don't want to play league that much to get a skin for a champ, but I also don't want my collection broken because Rito decides to release a prestige edition skin.

So let's sum this up real quick about how brilliant it is on their end to milk a cash cow like myself (I have spent a lot of money on the game), $20 for the complete pass, 2x $20 for 160 tokens for each price and a bunch of shit I don't want. Prestige skins nowadays feel like they are entirely bought not earned. 

When they first came out, I didn't really mind. I was still playing quite a bit and made a decent amount of tokens in a decent amount of time, but this is absurd. Prestige skins, which if we are being real are over-glorified chromas, should not cost me $60, not even including the extra masterwork chests I bought because I was confused about which prestige tokens the skin would use (but that one was my own stupidity). 

&#x200B;

tl;dr Prestige skins don't feel earned anymore, it feels like whoever can sink the most money gets the skin instead of earning it through the pass. I'm burnt out now because I just sank $60 to get a skin I should have had a week ago with a $20 pass.",2021-04-26 15:17:42,3.0,myryqv
8ww3x5fy,seven_shuriken,"Hello!

Today I want to share with you a drawing of Dragonslayer Galio made by me. I made it as a profile icon/picture. I don't play Galio, never tried to play him but I faced many of them and had played many matches with him as a team partner too. It's always good to have Galio protecting your team and when this champion goes Full AP deals massive amount of damage. Galio is of big help on team fights

I remember when Galio's magic shield was so strong after his rework that nobody wanted to face him on mid lane. AD champions going against him were having a difficult time, the most hillarious thing was to see how mage champions tried to lower his health bar. 

if I don't remember wrong the only mage to deal a decent aamount of damage to Galio when he got reworked was Veigar but even Veigar wasn't able to beat him with a full combo

Hope you guys enjoy my drawing. Stay safe and have a wonderful day!

I need help understanding how rank decay works. I'm currently d4 13lp (first time reaching diamond) and as of now it says I have 2 days left before derank/decay (forgot the term, I'm not home atm). My question is - how much time is that? Will tomorrow show 1 day left and then the next day derank me into plat 1 or after tomorrow it will turn into 24-23-22hours etc ?
Sorry for my English.

62efjf71,Katsumi41_,"I'm a GM enchanter support main (NA) who'se been playing the role for about 5 years now. From looking at the games that I've been playing this season, I realise that there is a huge issue with Support mythics (especially enchanters). 

To start with, my first problem comes from the fact that you're forced to build mythics first because of what they do, the stats they give and their overall strength. I have a couple of problems with the addition of mythics for enchanters, the first being that you are forced into an item that doesn’t exactly always matches your needs for a specific game. For example, there are some situations where the enemy team has a really high burst comp but if you're an enchanter, it is simply impossible to build something in reaction to that comp (Locket). Indeed, you can’t build Locket because it does not give an enchanter any of the stats it needs to be able to play the champ normally (mana regen or AP). I personally do not find any situation in which it is optimal to be overall weaker as a champion just to have the perfect item to win the game. From my perspective, this doesnt make any sense, because there are no more support items buildable allowing an enchanter to be tankier or to help the team survive a huge burst (having lots of fun this season trying to shield a Karthus ult with moonstone, it's REALLY useful). From what I remember from the other seasons, there was always something available to counter bursty teams, but now that mythics are here and because you’re forced to build them first and have only one of them, I feel like enchanters are losing a lot of build versatility and are less useful. Sometimes, I feel helpless from champ select because I know that Locket would be the perfect item but to build but that would simultaneously mean that I’ll lose lane because I won’t have enough mana regen or ap to have good shields or heals.

To add to this, on Feb 26 (I know it's a little old, there are no newer stats available), Mark Yetter posted to his twitter [an analysis on enchanter mythics](https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1365372589908975617/photo/1) ; this post perfectly portrays the delusion towards mythics (10 hits, 1 miss. Really?). I don't agree that it's a hit, because Enchanters are FORCED into Moonstone. Indeed, it is the only mythic that makes any sense for them in a lot of scenarios. For items that all have the same build (Kindlegem and Bandleglass Mirror), Moonstone is the best because of it's passive. When I think about Imperial Mandate, the item doesnt work on a lot of enchanters because it is too hard to proc in a lot of scenarios. For example, on Lulu, if you wanted to proc the item you'd have to put yourself in a dangerous position, which doesnt make sense when the most important thing as an enchanter is to stay alive. The safer choice would then be moonstone, since it's so much more easier to proc and you don't need to put yourself in danger to make the item efficient. Also, for Shurelyas, no matter how op the item is, I thing that it doesnt have it's place as a mythics. It's true that this patch, the item is REALLY op and people are starting to build it. Also the movement speed can be  interesting for an enchanter because it helps with everything. I just don't feel like movement speed is more important than helping a carry or having damage / sustain ; shurelyas is cool and everything, but it's more of a \*luxury\* than a real need. Also, the item is good right now because of how bad moonstone and mandate are (this patch was really harsh for moonstone..). 

Another major issue that I have with these items is that they take absolutely NO SKILL and are not rewarding at all . Moonstone should be a little bit more like [Athene's Unholy Grail](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Athene%27s_Unholy_Grail), where you have to do something to receive the healing. Just hiding behind someone and clicking w or e feels unrewarding\*. Imperial Mandate is a little bit more rewarding, but a lot of times, you don't have a choice to make because it procs on every target you attack (feels a little brainless). Shurelyas and Locket do not have this issue because they have actives, you are rewarded for having a good timing, it feels good to play those items. 

The mythic passive on moonstone might need some love too. How is it fair that the mythic passive for moonstone only empowers the item and not the champion or allies ? (right now, it's +10 healing to STARLIT GRACE, which is moonstone unique healing). This gives the me idea that  the item is more important than the champion. The passive of the item could be a % of better heals and shields  ; that way it won't feel so bad to build moonstone and the passive will benefit the enchanter, not the allies only.  For the other items, the passives make a lot of sense, because it empowers the champion and/or allies  (+15 AP on [Mandate](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Mandate), +5 AH on [Shurelyas](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Shurelya%27s_Battlesong), and +2 Armor/ MR increase to Consecrate on [Locket](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Locket_of_the_Iron_Solari)).

On a brighter note, these issues are not unsolvable :

Moonstone could be reworked to require skill (a little bit like athenes). The item would then not be too ''OP'' and it would feel way more rewarding. 

Mandate is a good idea as an item, but it needs to be stronger overall. Unfortunately, it is technically impossible to make it stronger because other lanes will start building it (sadge). It would be nice to see this item more so some enchanters can be played a little bit more (like nami, janna).

Riot should put Shurelyas as a Legendary item and Ardent Censer as a Mythic. Right now, the best item is moonstone because it gives a lot of substain but there are no items to ''Buff'' carries now. In earlier season (8-9-10), you used to have to make a decision - substain Vs. ADC empowering Vs. more team fights (or even something to remove cc, aka Mikaels). Having the possibility to choose ardent as a mythic would just make the builds more interactive and less boring. 

I would really speak about the other support items and boots too (why am I forced into ionians? :(), but  this post is already pretty long as it is. I just want to feel like my role is not all about the items anymore, but really about how I play. I shouldnt be rewarded because I bought an item and it won me the game. Finally, enchanter players should have the opportunity to think their build through and not do the same thing every game because it's the only thing that's viable. 

\*I've had people tell me the only reason I was in my elo is because of that item. Maybe Riot should realise that this item not requiring skill is an issue?",2021-04-26 03:18:39,12.0,myfcwp

As someone who likes to collect stuff, it would be so amazing to have small models of all champions that look somehow realistic. They might be plastic and they don’t have to be 1:1 detailed, but you should be able to use them in a tabletop RPG without killing the mood. Pretty sure I’m not the only one who would like to buy such a thing.

9nxcnns6,LPL-Official,"On January 9th, 2021, the LPL Spring Split began. Now, over three months later, we finally have our champions, our representative squad to be sent to the international stage. 

How did we get to this point? Well it was quite the roller coaster. Going into playoffs, one of the finalists - FPX - was not even expected to make it into the top 4, let alone come within a series win of MSI. They started their run with convincing trouncings of Rare Atom and JD Gaming, and proceeded to blow away the expectations with a deciding 3-0 over the eventual champions RNG, and besting a fan favorite in EDG. 

Their run however, would be cut short right at the very end. Royal Never Give Up, as the name implies, never gave up. And they cut it extremely close. A nailbiting 3-2 victory over Top Esports from the start of the losers bracket, which was capped off with a deciding backdoor victory, kept them in the running by the skin of the skin of the skin of their teeth. If that wasn’t enough, the second round of the losers bracket would be no kinder. Their series against EDG would similarly be a scrapfest, ending in RNG squeaking out the 3-2 win, avoiding the reverse sweep.

So then, the stage was set. An old organization with new and decidedly Uzi-less hearts, against a reborn phoenix in the final showdown. And a showdown it was. In the series, it seemed that FPX’s greatest enemies were themselves - a series of mechanical misplays from key members, combined with the unwavering solidity of the RNG lineup, would give many opportunities for the members of RNG to get set up for success, and each time they would spike down FPX. By a final score of 3-1, RNG would book their ticket to Iceland, yet another of countless international appearances.

Now, it is time to look forward. RNG are slated in group A, and notably will no longer be facing against the international wild card, Gigabyte Marines. Will they top the group? Can they stand up to the defending champs DK in the rumble and knockout stages? Tune in to this year’s Mid-Season Invitational, and find out!",2021-04-25 17:12:03,34.0,my4kqz

First of all - What i currently **working on** trying to improve:

\- Map awareness, yes i know i still lack a lot of it and constantly try to improve

\- A secure and macro specific gameplay, try to time dragons and objectives.

My champions:

Udyr

Hecarim

Evelynn

Amumu (havnt played him in a while)  


**My hardships:**

I have games where i have really weak damage to enemy champions. I try to ganke, but often i dont see any opportunities. Lanes fastpushing and shoving into enemy tower. (i'm honest i really dont like tower diving in solo q).   
Typically when i gank top, my bot dies and flames me. If i gank bot, my top flames. Normally my early and midgame is pretty even with the enemy jungler, but by then often either the enemy top, mid or bot lane is 10-20/0. And games typically go with ""report jungle, no gank"". Which honestly is just annoying if i didn't loose that lane, but get a round of ""report and blame the jungler"".

&#x200B;

**What should i do now?**

Honestly it isnt fun at the moment and maybe i should go back to ADC. I really want to  improve but maybe i focus on the wrong things. 

**So My question to you?**

Should i just live with the blame/is it normal?  
Is my champion pool wrong for low elo and should i play more snowbally junglers? (Khazix)  
Is my learning priority wrong?

j7vfq,redditmademeregister,"If your games are anything like mine (and I suspect they are based off the conversations about dodging and the unpopularity of jungling in the zeitgeist recently) then you've likely seen one if not all of the following:

* Flaming in champ select
* Griefing in champ select
* Troll picking in champ select
* Hostage holding in champ select
* Flaming in game
* Real inting in game
* Soft inting in game
* AFKers in game
* Spam pinging assist or q mark spam pinging people
* Spam pinging cooldowns of other players (smite, ult, etc)
* Spamming ff votes when winning
* Holding a lost game hostage by refusing to give up (but not playing to win)
* Flaming your own teammates in the game summary screen
* Poor winners flaming the losing team in the game summary screen
* Begging for reports in game and at the game summary screen

I'm likely to see one if not more than one of these *each* game that I am in. Yet in one game last week I experienced none of these behaviors. All due to one thing.

In the champ select screen no one said anything except for ""glhf"" even when I picked a non-meta jungler that is rare but I know how to play. No one flamed in game in either allied or all chat. No one spam pinged. No one soft inted. No one gave up even though we were getting punished early. No spam ff voting and no one said anything in the game summary screen except for ""ggwp"".

So what gives? Why was this game so different?

Ten internet meme points to Gryffindor to whomever guessed that someone from Riot was in our game. Just the simple of act of being there and observing the game in all phases eliminated ***all*** toxicity that was in abundant and dare I say common in every other game. This reminiscent of how drivers are suddenly on their best behavior when driving around a police office. Changing one's behavior if they are known to be observed is [The Hawthorne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).

Since the game has largely devolved into a state of ""the inmates running the asylum"" I think we are desperate need of something that I like to call Game Wardens. These players are essentially ""deputized"" by Riot and their flare is shown in champ select and in the game loading screen to let everyone know that they are being watched by someone that can expedite punishments on bad behavior much like you had a Riot employee playing on your team.

I originally thought that this should be tied to the honor system but I've been reminded that the honor system in its current incarnation means nothing and you can have a pretty high honor despite being a pretty bad ""actor"" in game - you just happen to have dodged consistent penalties (aka saying the ""bad"" words in game).

Until the current honor system is reworked to be more reflective of actual good game behavior I think that this should be a select few high elo players that have consistently demonstrated good behavior (not perfect behavior) in game. These players can then nominate others to join the Game Wardens program which they would be able to join after sufficient vetting... but be careful on who you nominate as if they are accepted and then they then abuse their privilege could cost you your Game Warden status as you essentially vouching for them (this prevents people from just trying to nominate their poorly behaving friends willy-nilly).

Over the course of a season your status as Game Warden is continually monitored and can be revoked if you're found to be abusing the privilege. So what does being a Game Warden actually do? What is this privilege? One is clearly a status symbol as not everyone could get into the program. Beyond that, you'd get priority reporting, as in your reports would always have an actual person reading them and evaluating them rather than hoping and praying that the automatic systems did their job. Additionally, you could have better reporting tools such as in game reporting with ""clip it"" functionality.

I don't necessarily believe in giving rewards to those in the Game Wardens program but I could see a skin line being created for those in the program (if you get booted you lose access to those skins) and maybe essence (blue / orange), RP, etc.

4wjsrddm,W1LDGAMER,"I have been playing league since S7. It was a problem for me because i got addicted , playing on average 10 games a day and becoming more toxic even out of league.  I stopped in 2020 june but 2 months ago i felt the urge to play again and i decided to give it a try and now im stuck in it again. I play 15-20 games a day when i have nothing to do and on school days i use up all my free time to play league only. I have quit playing every other game because i only want to play league but the bigger problem is that i dont even enjoy it,  i hate this game and every second i spend on it ,but i just cant stop playing it. I rage every game, flame my teammates, int games and basically go crazy over little shit and start trolling as much as possible whether it is stealing farm , telling enemies information , running it down mid , spamming slurs and hardcore flaming teammates and threahtening them and leaving games. Everyday i tell myself that flaming is useless and it wont make them perform any better but as soon as i get into a game and have bad teammates i start flaming and if they flame me back i immidiately start inting. When playing i have huge ego and i cant stand it when someone flames me or says anything negative to me , i will start inting immidiately. I have broken alot of mouses and keyboards because of that game and i just cant stop playing this game and i cant stop being toxic. Is there anyway i could stop my league addiciton or atleast become less toxic player because as of right now i have 31 perma banned accounts , i make new ones and do it all over again because my ego goes up by 1000% when playing league.

bps28j0o,HungrysamaD,"This is my take on how Nocturne can be changed to make his gameplay more interesting and better fit his nightmarish themes. Comments and feedback are appreciated :)

**Passive:** Nocturne’s next attack deals 120% damage to all enemies around him, healing him for 30% of the damage dealt. If there is only one target, Nocturne deals 200% damage, healing him for 60% of the damage dealt and instantly fearing them

Cooldown: 8s, reduces by 1s per auto attack.

After damaging an enemy 3 times, Nocturne’s next attack fears them for 1.5s. After an enemy is feared, they cannot be feared again for the next 8s.

&#x200B;

**Q:** Nocturne sends a trail of shadows in a line, dealing damage and marking all enemy champions hit for 5s. Marked champions leave a trail of shadows and are unable to see Nocturne while he’s on the trail. While nocturne is inside the trail, he also gains bonus movement speed and attack damage.

Nocturne is able to attack marked enemies without being seen by them.

&#x200B;

**W:** Nocturne phases his body from existence for 1-2s, becoming invisible and untargetable.

Passive: Nocturne gains bonus attack speed. Bonus attack speed is doubled while phased.

Nocturne also ignores unit collision while phased.

&#x200B;

**E:** Nocturne selects a feared enemy to haunt. After 2s, Nocturne may recast the ability to teleport to the haunted enemy, dealing damage and fearing surrounding enemies (except the target) for 1.5s.

Target may be haunted for up to 8s and enemies cannot see who is being haunted, except for the target.

&#x200B;

**R:** Nocturne reduces the vision of all enemy champions for 4 seconds. Recasting the ability allows him to quickly charge at an enemy champion at large range, dealing damage.

&#x200B;

**Playing as Nocturne:** Look for 1v1 fights. Pick off enemies who are wandering off on their own.

**Playing against Nocturne:** Stay together and communicate with the team to locate him in fights.",2021-04-26 13:18:41,0.0,myqaxt

r8via,Eirwn,"Hey there. 

Lol Player since 2011. 

Since 2019 I play only Ranked Flex queue.   
My team (5 man team - mostly always the same 5 people), is placed in Silver 2 - Silver 1 divisions.   
We play every day due to COVID. In S2021 we have played \~270 games. 

In 2021 season as well as 2020, we are stuck between S1 & S2.   
I guess this is ok if our gameplay level is that. 

BUT!   


The thing I wanted to discuss is the HUGE opponent skill gap I feel happening somewhere in S1.   


I will use the latest example in order to explain. 

We had a Winning streak of many games, facing challenges that were tough sometimes but manageable. Some of us reached 60+ points S1, and the lowest one was 80+ S2.   


SUDDENLY, the matchmaking became nightmarish. In 4 consecutive games we faced teams with 2 or more high platinum players, and completely destroyed us.   
They weren't games that we could somehow react. The opponents were from a completely other level.    
I checked their [op.gg](https://op.gg) and they had very few Ranked Flex Games, with huge win Rates.   
They might be in their way up to Flex Gold, but this  
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME! For more than a year!  


(You can check my stats here: [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=KaFFiR](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=KaFFiR)    


This huge GAP of ""difficulty"" in the matchmaking is concerning me, and this is why I started this discussion.

I mostly played in season 5 and 6 and I remember it was much easier to collect IP and buy champs, even without a crafting system. 

I've been purchasing the new player bundles and starter packs with RP (real money) because it's so difficult to get a good amount of champs.

We see some leaks (when the Chinese site was up we saw photos) for the Nontraditional Marksman, the evil Yordle and there was a photo of something like Zaun related with this text: Be ready for the new marksman (for botlane this time) and a glance of the toughest race of Runeterra, no one is more persevering than them.

Now... I'm thinking about **the toughest race of Runeterra** and below I will write what do I think fits that description.

01. Darkins
02. I'd say Voidborns but they have nothing to do with Runeterra. They are void related so I can exclude them.
03. Minotaurs???
04. Trolls???
05. If they use ""race"" as ""region"" I'd say Noxus, but I don't think they're using race same for region.

Now... Another Minotaur in the game? We don't expect one (and personally I don't want another one since Alistar has the perfect kit for a bull, there can't be another tank bull who could fit in this position). Imagine if Riot releases a new crocodile champ. Ok, but Renekton??? Same as another coyote and werewolf.

Another Troll? It doesn't sounds bad like the Alistar 2 idea because Trundle is a king and there can be his ""right arm"" bodyguard etc. You know? But still, I won't be hype.

Void and Noxus, I will not talk about them since they most likely aren't. 100%

What we got? Darkins. It's just too perfect. Double champion release: that Zaun (or whatever) ADC + it's ""half"" a Darkin support. But still, some say ""a Darkin in Zaun? It's too crowded and blahblah"". I don't know what to say. I know that it's gonna be perfect if there will be a darkin there... And yes, I said double champion release because I don't think there will be another Darkin with a mechanism like Kayn. Maybe I'm wrong.

10rpxz,HeyItsSplash,"If Riot really wants to improve soloq all they should do is add A TOGGLEABLE anonymous mode - Every player can choose in settings whether or not they want their Summoner names to become Summoner 1, 2, 3 in champ select and champion name in-game.

This would prevent people from using opgg and trolling/dodging whenever somebody is filled, on a low % wr champ or personal grudges (more of a high elo thing).

VALORANT already has anonymous mode and it's pretty successful even though there aren't any op.gg-like sites so I don't see a reason not to add it to League.

EDIT: To people who are saying how this would prevent them from dodging autofilled/bad teammates, good!

I do not think third party out of client websites should ever have any impact on competitive standings. 

Players who do not have access/ do not know about sites such as op.gg shouldn't be at a disadvantage from the get go. 

Dodging should never be used to gain a competitive edge.

The upsides of Anonymous mode vastly outnumber the downsides. Dodging would be less frequent, people wouldn't hold others hostage as often, people wouldn't be as toxic from the get-go (I say get-go cause people will always find excuse for their shit gameplay). Higher elos (D1+) would benefit even more than lower elos.

EDIT2: Idk why people get this idea that this would completely prevent you from dodging games. Anonymous mode would just make it so theres less people trolling and griefing standard players who have bad winrates on champs they had unlucky streak on or autofilled teammates who are comfortable with their filled role. If people are mental then you would still be able to dodge them lol. If",2021-04-24 11:36:39,1571.0,mxbvrn

6m4j0,Pandarandrist,"Hi everyone,

In the ongoing conversation on dodging's place in the game, I wanted to do some analysis for my own benefit, and thought the community might enjoy to see the results of my work. [I did a lengthy analysis yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mwhhtz/want_to_climb_dodge_more_a_mathematical_analysis/), which didn't gain much traction for a variety of reasons. One of the issues is that I just gave too much detail about the analysis, and people inferred bolder claims that I was attempting to make. So, in the analysis I did today (which I think is more interesting) I'll not give specific numbers, and just talk about general trends and tendencies.  

--------------------------


What my model assumes:  
-----------------

1. Any given game has a normal distribution for win%. This means there is a bell curve centered around 50% for your chance to win any given game at your skill level based on champ select. Sometimes, the teams are even, sometimes they are not.  
2. If your MMR grows above your skill level, which is fixed, your win rate decreases. The inverse is also true. The difference in win% is larger the bigger the difference between your skillMMR and your MMR.  
3. Your LP gain on a win depends on the difference between your LP and MMR. The change in LP gain is larger the bigger this difference.  
4. You always dodge the worst lobbies. This assumes you are perfect at predicting, based on everything that happens in champion select, whether your lobby is in the bottom x% of your overall lobbies, and also that this maps perfectly on to win%. This is the biggest assumption, but adding imprecision on the players ability to judge the lobby would not add to the analysis. If you don't believe that players can *ever* tell what the worst lobbies are that are likely to result in losses, then you will find this entire process pointless (which it would be). I think players have at least some power in predicting wins and losses.    

--------------  
Results
-  

The graph I've attached shows a player who starts ""hardstuck"". Their skill, LP, and MMR are all equal to each other. They're right where they're supposed to be. Then, they start dodging. The graph shows the LP they gained over a 200-game season if they always dodge the worst x% of their games. [As you can see](https://i.imgur.com/Al6Rs4x.png), there is not only a benefit to dodging the worst games, but even the games where they are at a slight disadvantage. The specifics of this graph are imprecise, and depend on many factors, but the underlying principle is true, and depends on very little. If you dodge games that you are more likely to lose, you will see benefits as a result.    

----------------  

Conclusion
-  




My little soapbox is that this isn't how the system should work. Without MMR penalties for dodging, it is always beneficial to dodge even the slightest perceived disadvantage. That is, only if players can truly detect disadvantage in champion select. I don't think players are as good at it as they think they are, but I still think we generally have this skill. If your champ was banned, or counterpicked, a dodge is a no-brainer from an LP perspective.",2021-04-25 04:41:28,56.0,mxshyy

we007,ItsGex,"Hello guys, I made a new infographic, this time showing Ming and Wei's impressive performance as a duo in RNG, the representative of the LPL in the MSI. This infographic explains one of the many plays by this duo that took place in the final against FPX.

\- Infographic: [https://imgur.com/a/7NHoPfV](https://imgur.com/a/7NHoPfV)

\- Moment of the play: [https://youtu.be/8tm7fl\_JYzo?t=435](https://youtu.be/8tm7fl_JYzo?t=435)

\- Transcription:

1 - Both junglers look for a first pathing to the toplane. Wei reaches top before Tian but uses his tempo advantage trying to help Xiaohu without result instead of taking the crab.

2 - Tian arrives later to the river but goes directly to the crab, forcing Wei to go to the bot objective. As a consecuence of this, Tian can go back to the base before Wei, who keeps farming the crab, and get the tempo advantage.

3 - Ming uses his bot pressure to reset and check Wei´s raptors and toplane, since they were exposed to an invade/gank due to the tempo advantage of Tian. After checking raptors Ming moves to the toplane because it’s the only place where Tian can force a play. Also, Xiaohu’s wave is slowpushing towards Nuguri, leaving the toplaner from RNG in a perfect situation to be ganked and killed. 

4 - Ming arrives to the toplane, punishes Nuguri, who was trying to threat Xiaohu, and helps to fix the wave. At the same time, Wei recognizes that Tian keeps farming his jungle because he hasn’t shown up in top or raptors and skips his golems to recover the tempo he lost in the first crab, going even with Tian.

5 - Xiaohu, Ming and Wei use the slowpush that threatened RNG’s toplaner to dive Nuguri. Tian is not able to stop them due to the numerical superiority that Ming created with the roam.

6 - With this play, RNG stops the snowball of Nuguri and disables Tian’s advantage in the jungle.",2021-04-25 01:32:20,79.0,mxonvt

80gelfkp,Kurt_Valenti,"To me Yone was the worst desision that Riot ever took. I undestand themed champions, but that does not mean that they should share the same passive, and the same Q and equivalent W, E, and Rs.

Igamine Teemo 2, same mushrooms, same blinding attack, same poison, but instead of turning invisible he blinks or flashes, and instead of runing fast, he turns invisible.... 

Imagine Yi 2 but instead of healing when meditating, he had some kind of invulnerability instead....

Imagine Nasus 2 but instead of stacking with his Q he stacked the W.

If you mained any of this champions and you would always have two options if one gets banned you pick the other one.

I am an OTP Azir, and for me Yasuo was the worst, he counters me hard, there where no clear counterplay guides in youtube, hell, ProGuides counter play video ACTUALLY says ""make your jungler gank him a lot"", you can look it up. So what did I do? I banned him, I perma banned him, and what happens next? Yasuo 2 comes out... 

I learned every match in midlane, I can win every match exept Yasuo, and now banning him is useless because There is a guy with the same exact passive that is a huge part of what makes yasuo so bad for me, he has the exact same spammable Q and the exact same 3rd Q but with an added dash and the rest of his kit has the same funcion even if it does it a bit differently.

You may want to say that I should just get good, but I did, I leaned every match and really investigated this one, I leaned how to play against my other counters, Zed, Fizz, Diana... And I got to a point whereI was really happy with my way of playing, but Yasuo and Yones counterplay and play style are so similar that its really annoying to ban one just for my opponent to pick the other one.

ad59sclb,Southern-Sprinkles92,"I had always been thinking that ""Loser's queue"" is just a myth caused by a series of unfortunate bad match-ups. Until recently, I have never had a clearer ""hit"" by it. I think Loser's queue DOES exist, but it might not be want you are thinking (e.g. Riot intentionally wanting you to lose).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- *Loser's Queue is effectively caused by players assigned off-roles (not playing their main role) - which somehow Riot thinks is a good idea (might be good a few years ago but not anymore) and this has cascading effects and is causing a major match-making flaw.*

&#x200B;

**So, what happened?**

I recently started using this application called [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/) (I am not sponsored, obviously) and was able to start realizing some of my weaknesses and really started to climb. But once I was about to get to Platinum 3, magical things happened (woah). 

I just started to get bad games over bad games over bad games. I tried my best to carry myself out, but the teams I got just simply ran it down and refused to even try - just ""ff15"" every single game with 5+ deaths pre 15 mins. 

I eventually got demoted back to gold and my win rate hits EXACTLY 50% (333w - 333l) and suddenly I started to climb again. I was able to punch out 2 6-wins streaks and back to platinum (see image). However, it added a good 30+ games for me to climb back to the original position.

&#x200B;

**What I observed**

During this period of ""Loser's queue"", I actually monitor my team vs enemies team on Mobalytics. Some of the match-ups are simply unbelievable:

* almost all of the losers match-ups are with almost an entire team with sub 45% win rate
* There are off-roles on my team most of the time, while the enemy teams had less
* There were a game where 3 of my teammates were with sub 25% WR and I simply dodged it.
* There were a game where the system put 4 ADC main (me included) on the same team, 3 of them being secondary roles

&#x200B;

**Problem with off-roles**

Regardless of what kind of bad match-ups I had, I think they all shared a common theme - Off-Roles. Spectacularly, the system puts you in a harder match-up by assigning off-roles to your team to make it ""more challenging"". This might be a good idea a few years ago, but nowadays people have gotten way better at the game, and a tiny bit of offset in skill level of specific role can really bleed into the game. You can't expect players to play their secondary role at a remotely close level to their main role.

Off-Roles introduces serious negative cascading effects to the match-making and really kills the quality of the games:

* People assigned off-roles are less motivated to play the game (not to mention about auto-fills)
* Less motivation leads to not trying (crying ff 15)
* Not trying leads to even larger gap against opponent laner (just running it down)
* The other 4 players could be seriously tilted and this effect leaks into future games
* Sometimes  you are in a losing streak because of this and NOW you are assigned to play off-roles

This negative feedback loop above just keeps going on and on and spreads across a large pool of players and eventually building up a very toxic and anti-competitive environment.

&#x200B;

**Last words**

I am not entirely sure what is a good solution for this. I think Riot also acknowledge the problem of Off-Roles and is planning to address it. I think if at least avoid assigning people to secondary when on a losing streak would at least help a bit. Just my 2 cents.

They should really implement something to lock them out for longer period of time or to force you into the game after accepting it to punish this behavior. The Pick/ban phase is part of the game and you shouldn't be able to get out of it once you see a team is not to your liking or the odds favor the enemy team. That's part of the whole game.

x8my1,Vinvil,"Recently I started queuing up bot lane in normal games to experiment a bit. After several games, I’ve come to a couple of realizations. 

First, after learning that Samira ult can deal 2k damage, it made me stop wanting to improve with Kalista (for now) because that situation was a good demonstration of how rewarding different champs within a role archetype can be. I saw how much more effort I would need to invest on Kalista to contest a Samira in the late game, if the Samira is given an almost optimal condition. While I like to challenge myself in this game, it was a bit discouraging to witness that moment.

Secondly, I enjoy the dynamic of the lane being dictated by the supports and junglers. In a solo lane, I would see Tristana and Lucian players being able to play aggressive because it would be safer for them to do so compared to bot lane. Champions that could easily play aggressive are restrained from doing so by the presence of the opposing support (usually). Dragon is heavily contested by both junglers so there is rarely a game where neither jungler shows up bot lane to start something.

Lastly, the amount of synergy in bot lane makes me look forward to finding another random and seeing how it will go. I know it’s a bit of an oxymoron but I relish in those moments when the support and I are on a similar wavelength without having to say a word to each other. There’s a sense of satisfaction that comes from them and I hope the support feels the same way. This alone is what makes me consider switching to bot lane

I did some quirky bot lane comps as well such as:

kn5ab24,TheFourthAct,"**Imagine this:**

At the start of the season, everyone gets 3 ""LP Redemption Tokens"" by default. A token can be consumed to regain your LP lost from a single match. You're given an option in the post game lobby if you'd like to use a token or not, OR you can go to your match history and redeem it on any defeats in the 10 most recent matches.

Someone rage quits? Token. Someone runs it down? Token. Your neighborhood loses power? Token.

Sometimes life happens and we have to suck up a loss, but the current ""LP mitigation system"" feels like a consolation prize. 

The system I'm suggesting provides the player the self efficacy to decide when he or she has been unfairly treated and actively choose to protect him/herself. Additionally, I believe this would help relieve the feeling of hopelessness we have all experienced from time to time playing ranked. 

Now, let's talk a little about the honor system...

&#x200B;

***Honor System***

In its current state, the honor system is...well... kind of pointless. 

Honoring a player gives them some minor recognition in the post game lobby, but beyond that, what do they get? An honor orb that's likely going to give him/her a champion they already have? I'd take a bet that most players find the value in honor orbs fairly miniscule and thus aren't particularly compelled to collect more.

What if the honor system focused on **rewarding** honorable behavior with something players could really find value in?

&#x200B;

**Imagine this:**

The honor a player receives from his/her teammates at the end of the game goes towards filling a progress bar. This progress bar, when completed, awards the player with an LP Redemption Token!

The goal of this new system would be to encourage honorable behavior. 

People wouldn't necessarily feel the need to single handedly carry every single match to win, but also behave in a pro-sportmanship manner. Maybe you're not in a position to carry (too behind, having a bad game, etc.), so instead, you put your efforts in helping a teammate who *is* in a position to carry with the hopes that they might honor you after the game, granting you progress towards your next token. In the current state of League, a player who feels he or she is unlikely to carry is a lot more likely to give up entirely.

In the long run, I believe that we would see honorable players ascend the ranked ladder, thus encouraging those below to behave similarly.

*Disclaimer:* 

*The amount of honor in which one would need to be rewarded with an LP Redemption Token would need to be managed with a careful eye. But in my mind, the ideal honorable player should be able to earn no more than 5 per season (on top of the 3 default that everyone receives at the start).*

&#x200B;

***Is the System Perfect?***

Absolutely not. 

What about someone who is new to League starts off at Iron III only to be surrounded by all the dishonorable trolls at the bottom of the pool? What about people who may attempt to 'sell' honor?

This is why I've brought this post to ***you.*** 

Do you like the ideas I've suggested? What would you add or change to make it better? 

Tell me in the comments! 

I'd love to hear how you think we can foster a healthier and more honorable environment for the League of Legends community together.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and best of luck in your games!

2b0ijpdm,scon25x,"I am not a Renekton noob. I have M7 on him and with around 120k points but I am not a Renekton otp. This just came into my thoughts. There is nothing in his kit that screams he is an early game lane bully. However majority of players think he is. But lets think about it:

- He has 125 attack range.
- He has no ranged poke ability or poke ability to cs from afar.
- He doesn't deal any percent damage at all (maximum, minimum or current). It is all flat damage.
- The healing from Q is flat healing as well and not percent.
- His Q cooldown doesn't reduce per rank.
- He has 100 fury total not 150 so he can't utilize 3 empowered abilities in a combo.
- His only form of CC is single target and self CC's himself as in he cannot move while the enemy is stunned.
- His ultimate doesn't even give him bonus AD, he doesn't have a devastating level 6 to destroy the lane.

So what we got here is an ""early game lane bully"" that has no poke or ranged harass. Has one of the lowest attack ranges in the game. Gated by long cooldowns. Cannot fully utilize his passive because he is gated to two emp abilities. And one form of CC which CC's himself. 

Renekton without stacked fury is worthless. Since he is low range and has no ranged harass, literally you can zone him from the wave level 1 and he loses the lane.

He isn't an early game lane bully. If you want an early game lane bully look at Gnar, Aatrox or Jayce. 

In my opinion it is not worth picking Renekton. Renekton is only good at level 1 basic attack fights because he stat checks the enemy laner, and his emp W which breaks the shield from broken Shieldbow.",2021-04-26 07:44:14,0.0,mykpqz

8urfm94r,Minute_Course747,"So, with all the dodging discussion going around, I wanted to give a suggestion I haven't seen yet: if 3 people on a ranked solo team agree, the game gets dodged without any LP AND MMR loss, but you have to attach a report of the reason why. If a person dodges by themselves, then LP AND MMR are slightly decreased and redistributed among the enemy team. This way, if someone is trolling/holding champ select hostage, your team can agree to dodge with no consequences for them, and without the MMR - LP disparity abuse, plus can flag how many times, and for what reason someone is often reported (trolling? Off-meta? Autofill? OTP banned?). I mean, nobody wants to play with an autofilles jungler, but at the same time, I don't think anyone wants them banned either. On the other hand, you can ban the people ACTUALLY trolling. This, in addition to role preference selection, I think would be the 2 changes that make LoL a lot better in this department.
Edit: people aren't realizing it would be LESS dodges. Right now, 1 person doesn't want to play = dodge. That way, it would need 3 people not wanting to play, or someone willing to give up MMR.

the score line is 19 V 4 at 17 minutes, no one is motivated to play out the game anymore,

yet you have that individual or two that refuses to FF.

&#x200B;

Sure they say, your team comp is late game specific they might argue!

So buckle down, dont FF and lets drag the game for another 20-30 minutes!

Simply put, accepting early defeats EVEN if the possibility of winning is never 0% (Who knows the enemy might have an AFK mid way through). Sometimes it is just not worth the mental toxicity and genuine dislike of playing a highly likely lost match.

Its frustrating waiting an extra 20 minutes or so until players genuilely hit the FF vote when it should of been done ages ago, I get that all games are potentially ''winnable'' in a SoloQ enviroment with great un-certaintys.

But is it worth really enduring that mental anguish instead of gracefully accepting defeat and moving on to the next one?

I say this because our team recently ff a game at 22 minutes, sure we werent doing extremely bad to the point it was un-carriable, but we also knew individually that it was better for our mental sanity to just accept the lose EVEN though it was somewhat winnable if we managed to stick it out for late game.

I waive any Copyright of my work, it is free for all and open source, everyone can use it and I will never claim any Copyright on this work. If the mods here are ok with it (please let me know) I will release the Word Document on my Google Drive and Link it here.

Thanks to the Wikipedia Page of LoL and it's ambitious editors that I used a lot during this project :)

The two Hydra items can be scraped, they are not meant to be serious. But I left them in because I kinda like the idea.

Also, the Magic Pen and Armor Pen items are probably limiting each other out. I didn't do Item limitation on purpose and is free for discussion.

&#x200B;

**Purpose:**

Ever since the new Rework I felt that many Champions are lacking great Items, So i set there with the Wikipedia open and thought of new Item combination, brainstormed what Stats it should have and what unique passive it could have.  I made items for group of Champions that I thought didn't have enough. The only class I thought had enough items was Mages, I think they can use some AP Bruiser items too - But I didn't add Mage Items specifically.

**Regarding Balance:**

Yes I know, these items are very likely not balanced, and I am aware of that, I am a hardstuck Gold 3 Player with no skill - regardless, I invite everyone to share their thoughts on them, what should be changed and every kind of constructive feedback is welcome. Furthermore, I am sorry if i offended everyone with these Items, I tried to make them rather weaker than stronger while aiming for the middle ground. What's most important is their concept, they can be nerfed/buffed later anyway.

I also liked the Idea of giving Protective Instinct to more support enchanter items, because they should be able to choose between Heal and Shield Power (for better Heal) and Protective Instinct (Anti Grievous Wounds / Shield Reaver) similarly to how Assasines can customize between Lethality (against Squisies) and Armor pen (for Tanks). Grievous Wounds gets mostly picked up because of Bruiser/Goredrinker rather than a Soraka - and she is not in a great spot currently.

&#x200B;

**Regarding Item Naming:**

I simply extended the current Item Name ""Pool"". I tried to use as many Single Word names (e.g Soulraiser) as there are now (e.g Goredrinker), I also used Phrases (Blade of the Ruined King - Book of the Ancient) like current items have.

&#x200B;

I additionally added Riot Employee Nicknames randomly (Not because I know them, but rather because current Items also have them). I also ensured that all items have a ""Slang word"" (e.g Liandries, Trinity, BoRK) so they are easier to communicate within the game, as well as on Social Media

14gk19i2,MutedSwordfish,"Hello this my 1/7 post of trying to bring discussion on why adc is op and how bruisers are weak. 

Sources: https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items U.gg 

I’m going to say it. If you look at u.gg you won’t see an adc without kraken, collector, or IE. 

11 out of 21 adcs go kraken primarily 

15 out of 21 adcs go IE primarily 

0 champions  go wits end or silver mere dawn primarily

This makes sense as excluding a few like draven, jhin, and jinx all adcs are just statsticks statchecks. When you are playing adc you don’t want the most coolest actives or the coolest passives you just want stats, that is it, stats.

Let’s look at j4, a champion with above average health. What would happen if he built gore drinker at level 18 with 4 items. I choose j4 because he is pretty average health for a bruiser. 

J4 base health at level 18 is 2100. J4 has gore drinker, Tabi, steraks, thornmail. Bumping his health to 3250 health. Jarvans attack damage at level 18 is 121.8. After the items and runes. 212.2 (248.2 conqueror stacked)ad. Now let’s set his hp to 1 gaining bonus ad from gore drinker. J4 now has 241.9(282.9 conqueror)ad. When he taps gore drinker when dueling he should heal a lot right? Well he only heals 312.9(330.6 with conqueror stacked). And it’s hilarious how adc mains still complain about the heal.

bqz8aczu,LDCOLD,"I don’t know how interesting it will be, but I spent quite a lot of time writing a character that could become part of the Summoner's Rift.
Bastina is ascended, looking like a large desert cat. A seeker of knowledge who wanders the world in search of the lost fragments of the culture of her ruined country, but also new discoveries. Her history before becoming an ascended is covered in darkness, but the reason for her becoming on a par with Nasus and Renekton is her amazing discoveries in science and magic, which were appreciated by the Emperor of Shurima - Azir's grandfather. After her reincarnation, she embarked on a journey through a truly vast empire in search of new objects for research. Returning back, she handed over her manuscripts to Nasus for storing new information about the world and soon set off on a new journey. During one of these expeditions, news of Azir's unsuccessful ascension overtook her. As quickly as she could, she arrived at the ruined palace. The library was destroyed. Bastina couldn't believe it. For many weeks she tried to find the remains of books in the rubble, but found only scraps of pages. In her hearts, she decided that Nasus was to blame. He did not save the library and confused something in the ascension ritual. Directing her tear-stained eyes to the sun descending beyond the horizon, Bastina vowed that she would restore the lost knowledge of her homeland, after which she left in an unknown direction.
So, let's go directly to the champion.

Basic characteristics:

Health: 244 at level 1. 42 units of health per level. 1000 by 18.
Health Regeneration: 0
Mana: 509 at the first level. 76 units per level. 1801 to 18.
Mana Regeneration (Over 5 Seconds): 12.25 at Level 1 1.25 per level. 33.5 at level 18.
Attack power: 52 at level 1. 4 units per level. 120 by 18.
Attack speed: 0.638 base. + 2.5% per level. Bottom line: + 42.5% attack speed at 18.
Attack completion rate (part of the animation, after which only the death of the character can interrupt the attack): 21.24%
Armor: 38 by 1. +3.5 per level. 101 to 18
Magic Resistance: 32 to 1. +4 per level. 66 to 18
Movement Speed: 338

Passive ability:
Every 5% of base mana regen is equal to 3% of base health regen. 2 units of health are equal to 1 unit of mana. The champion deals only 75% of his damage, but all physical damage becomes magical (including effects on hit). Lifesteal, healing of allies, red enhancement effect does not restore champion's health.

Q: Cost: 10% of your current mana. Cooldown: 10 seconds (conditional)
Effect: The champion unleashes a disarming wave of energy around him, which prevents the affected champion from using basic attacks for X seconds, and also ignites champions and minions, dealing damage in the amount of 10/20/30/40/50 + 0.2% (+ 0.01 from AP) of their maximum health per second for 5 seconds. Minions drop Page Scraps that increase Bastina's maximum mana by 5. Every 100 scraps increase her base mana regen by 15%

W: Energy Shield
Passive: 90% (conditional) of all damage taken is absorbed by the champion's mana, spending 2 mana per damage. If there is not enough mana, Bastin takes full damage.
Active: Bastina places a shield on an ally, which redirects some of the damage dealt to him to Bastina's mana. Maintaining a shield costs 20 mana per second.

E: Cost: 10% of maximum mana. Cooldown 5 seconds
Bastina accumulates energy in her fist for 1.5 seconds, after which her next basic attack will deal an additional X (+ 20% of AD) magic damage and push the enemy away from herself.

R: Cost: 100% of current mana
Passive: Unique kill of champion / dragon / epic monster, Bastin gains 100 page scraps.
Active: Bastina deals damage to enemies and applies shields to allies for 3 seconds in an amount equal to the number of scraps.

The character is meant as a guardian tank, which must extinguish enemy initiations. Art is not yet available, but I hope he will appear soon.

UPD: This champion will be revorked, because only her W and Passive was good",2021-04-25 14:45:14,2.0,my2pjq

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My honest opinion about both items

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)If you are playing vs Squishies run electrocute and build Night Harvester---->More Dmg=Oneshot 

2)If you are playing vs Tanks run Conqueror and build Shurelya's Battlesong ---->You can engage with it to proc conqueror faster and then disengage with your Zhonya's

3)Shurelya's is a gold efficient item so even if you are behind you can still afford it 

4)Harvester might be more expensive but if you snowball the early game then it's a huge 1 item power spike

5)Shurelya's gives you more Haste (can be useful for cougar Nidalee)

6)Harvester gives you more HP and AP (Can be useful for Spears/Heal)

3slh1to5,Aviqu,"We all know the problem, people in champ select are not willing to play their lane, can't accept a ""no"", and then begin to troll. We also witnessed natural trollers, which just play to destroy the peoples league experience, but these are rather rare, rare but there.

We all know, that we can forfeit the game after 20 minutes if four people are agreeing to not further play the game.

\- So what if Riot adds a ""Kicking-System"" into the champ select, instead of the rather useless report option. If there is a troller, the other players can initiate a kick-voting, and if four people agree, the game will be dodged. I can see a problem, with weird otps like rakan mid and stuff, but everyone uses and can just look after their specific stats on the champion with [blitz.gg](https://blitz.gg), [op.gg](https://op.gg), [porofessor.gg](https://porofessor.gg) and so on, so they can make sure, they have a player who tries to win. And the best point of all that, you don't have to waste your own time, after your dodge, because you decided to not play with a player who tries his best to lose the game.

There of course should also be a punishment for the trolling-player, who got kicked, and the punishment should be exponential, so after he got kicked three times, he has to wait a good amount of time to play again. But i don't think, the punishment has to kick off pretty hard, because you can get kicked, for the stuff i mentioned on the paragraph above.

bk5tq5kv,I_hate_supports,"I'll explain you very briefly, but first let's get a few points across:

- AD items are broken;

- AP items are trash;

- armor items are broken;

- mres items are trash.

- tabi, bami, bramble are broken and cheap.

So what do we do?

We pick an AP champ top, and we build him/her tank. Take Akali for example, you pick Akali, you build tabi bramble bami then gauntlet into mejais then stopwatch.

What this gives you is:

- stonewall lane so you can't get snowballed on and you can't get ganked (if you manage to get killed with this build unistall the game);

- free damage to the opposing toplaner because not only you have AP base damage, you also deal magic damage with both bramble and bamis, this means the opposing (AD) toplaner is getting his damage heavily reduced while yours is almost true dmg

- a legendary item for 1600 gold (mejai) that instantly triggers gauntlet's free 100 HP, and mejais is broken af in general;

- zhonya, the only other actually broken AP item in the whole game.


This also fixes your teamcomp if your midlaner goes AD

I don't get it. Nothing has changed. I downloaded the game after half a year break and here how my first 5 games went.

1st game:

I'm doing good as support , we win botlane in first minutes by doubling enemy and right after that remake was made because their top was afk

2nd game:

we loose lane, we loose the game

3rd game:

We win, botlane pretty stale i had 2/4/8 on support and seemed like a equal match

4th game:

We loose, our jg 1/12, we won botlane

5th game:

we pop off, my friend on adc finished with 20/2 and i had 8/4/23 on support , our jg 1/12 , their jg 22/4

matchmaking is still trash, there should be at least 2 ranks below iron for all of these players. Doesn't matter if i pop off or not. better jg wins, that team wins the game.

az9vru31,kayndrama,"The number one reason I personally dodge games is because X player is trolling.  Most often it's a mid laner who got filled to a role other than mid and the person who got mid refuses to trade roles.  I've had my ADC mid lane wannabe lock in ghost cleanse Yuumi and declare they're going AD Yummi.  Forget the fact that if I play this game I'm going to lose LP and MMR.  My sanity is more valuable than both I'm going to dodge for that reason alone.

So why do mid laners cause so many issues, simple they get autofilled more often than any other role.  The Yuumi claimed to have gotten his secondary choice 5x in a row so now he either gets mid or trolls and ints.  Mid lane is way too popular of a role and there's more than 1 reason this is the case.  Most importantly the role is over powered and has been season after season.   Mid  also offers the largest number of available champs that can viably be played there compared with any other role.

Solutions: most importantly mid lane needs to lose power, ideally nerfing mid lane minion gold and experience, this role needs to become more supportive and slightly less carry oriented. Next we need to stop releasing new champs designed for mid lane, this hopefully will help decrease the number of players who queue for mid.

Autofill causes dodges on it's own and it also causes players who don't want to dodge to troll.  Just remove autofill and watch the number of dodges go down drastically.",2021-04-26 04:33:03,0.0,mygxrx
ita7q,Dohello,"whenever the jungle gets a leash from a dot damage champ such as Twitch, Teemo, brand etc., it is very frustrating when the dot damage steals the buff. Yes you could argue that it is the jungles responsibility to time the attack properly and what not, but this can make clear speeds slower and if you wait too long the buff will start running towards the player who applied the dots, and it is just silly that this is something you need to worry about at all. There is not a single scenario where this is intentional and it can basically make the game over for the jungle. The laners know what happened and the enemy jungle can now take advantage of literal bad luck. Why doesn't Riot just make it so when an ally is attacking is applying dot damage to the first camp that the ally jungle is attacking, the dot damage can not take it below 1hp. It would be such a simple quality of life fix that would have no impact on the balance of the game. They can make this only apply to the very first camp of the game on the allies side of the jungle, and then it goes back to normal.

xg4ay,tapi7,"Hey!

This is my suggestion:

XY the Trapper/Ambusher

&#x200B;

Passive - Minefield. When XY places 2 or more traps in a K range they will form a bomb network. Triggering the traps with Detonate will trigger every trap in the network. The size of the network is increased at 3 / 9 / 15 lvl

Q - Detonate - Trigger the targeted trap. 

W - Tripwire / Snare trap / Landmine - 

Tripwire - automatically triggers if someone walks over them. Slowing them down an dealing medium damage. 

Snare Trap - When detonated snares everyone in the area.

Landmine - When detonated deals damage.

\-- These traps can only be placed on the ground. 

E - Laser sensor / Immobaliser / Thermal sensor

Laser sensor - pings enemies that passes by.

Immobaliser - upon walking into the sensor will send out a wave that immobilizes the enemy for 0.25s.

Thermal sensor - Upon actiavation damages enemies in a line. 

These sensors can only be placed on terrain, such as walls, towers, inhibitors.

R - Stances

Track - Can place Laser sensor and Tripwire. 

Ambush - Can place Snare Trap and Immobaliser

Assassinate - Can place Landmine and Thermal sensor

&#x200B;

Only 2 of these form's traps can be activated at a time. The traps used in the oldest form are weaker than the ones in the last used form.

You got people bitching before the ban phase is even over, shitty team comp, or werid trollish picks?

Dodge

Not only did my climb become smoother and more consistent, I was also happier and grinding out more games before I felt worn out. I wasn't necessarily trying to play stacked games, just not gimp myself into ones where it would be an uphill battle from the start. I didn't give enough shits to op.gg my teammates, I just needed to have a team that wasn't going to get steamrolled or biting at each other from the get go. 

Dodging wasn't an issue per say, but the outcome when riot has poorly addressed the reasons I and others would want to dodge.

I feel like Azir is in a similar boat to a degree

Which sucks as they are really cool champs, but they got axed for being good exclusively in pro play few years ago.

Her playstyle is around stacking autos, in a oneshot meta. Stacking autos isn't a common privilege when most tanks can now run you down before you get 5 spears in with HOB. (Hence the lethality path HOB+q+e) for a fast combo

az9vru31,kayndrama,"The very nature of solo Q means dodging needs to exist.  For example if I hover Kayn during champ select, none of my teammates hover anything, I lock Kayn in as first pick.  The enemy team locks in Malphite and Garen with their picks and my team proceeds to draft all AD.   This game is an auto loss in any elo gold or above I'm going to dodge it, this is fair because my team trolled by going full AD and not only that, knowingly going full AD into 2 champs that are going to hard abuse this fact.  Maybe my team was intentionally trolling maybe they just didn't realize or care that we're all AD into Malphite and Garen, either way since I have no control over what my teammates do I need the ability to dodge.  It's a measure of my skill to recognize that my team hard lost during champ select due to no falut of my own.  The guy who doesn't dodge this situation and loses the game is less skilled than me for not realizing what needs to be done and deserves to lose LP.

Now for those of you who want to say it's on me for picking Kayn, while he's my favorite champ I'm not a one trick, and had I known what my teams picks would have been happy to pick Eve, Fiddle, or some AP champ but since we don't have voice comms I didn't know my teams (admittedly terrible plans).

Then we have trolls and autofilled one tricks.  For example I had a guy tell me he's a OTP Ashe and lock in Ashe top into Rengar.  Maybe the game isn't an auto loss but I can guarantee you there's going to be a fed Rengar and a useless Ashe in this game.  Maybe this guy honestly thinks his best chance to win the game is always playing Ashe despite him getting top and not ADC, what I do know is I don't want to play this game.

&#x200B;

All of these situations and more are likely to result in me losing a game regardless of whether I play well or play badly which means it's not a good measure of my skill.  The only real option I have in any of these situations is to dodge.

4o8dlhl3,GipJoCalderone,"[Champion Roadmap](https://lol.qq.com/news/detail_m.html?docid=8382617498888517813)

Guess they posted it early. (Article is down, translation below.)

TLDR: Dr.Mundo is nearly done, preview images of 2 best skins; Yordle got delayed, her design is now a traditional mage instead; Sentinel of Light will come first, and it's a midlane ADC; early concepts of Udyr; New teaser of the botlane ADC which looks like Zaun related. 

Edit: For the teaser they used the term ""the toughest race of Runeterra"" along with the ADC, from the wording I don't know if it's an extra description of the ADC or it's for another champion which will be support.

Whole article translation:

Hello everyone:

It has been so long since we opened the storyline of the return of The Ruined King in our roadmap last time. Even though we still don't have too much information to share, we still would like to bring you the updates of the information we told you in our last roadmap.

In January, we told you that three champions after Viego will be connected with his return. Gwen is one of them, though her future is still a mystery. She plays an important role in this complicated story, but what exactly it is…we still don't know yet.

Let's put Viego, Gwen and the ever-approaching doom aside and talk about Dr.Mundo's VGU first. Then we would talk about the 2 new champions coming next, including an update to the mysterious mage's release time. Finally it's the Udyr VGU that you voted in the beginning of this year.

Entering Mundo's World

It has been a while since last Dr.Mundo's dev blog, we can finally say that The Zaunite Madman will see you guys again. Thanks for your patience (he has too many skins).

First, let's share some voiceovers of Dr.Mundo. Mundo's new voice line sounds a little bit smarter than current Mundo——that's inevitable, because current Mundo doesn't sound like a doctor at all, and certainly can't reflect his (questionable) reasoning of his treatment. But we also mentioned that we would like to keep his dark and comedic (...and silly) style, and voiceover is a big part of that.

Another content we want to share is the final version of Rageborn Dr.Mundo splash art. In our last dev blog we showed the concept art of this skin, now we have finished.

Lastly, his legendary skin Corporate Mundo is in the final polishing stage. We will make sure this skin meets the standard and expectation of legendary skins. Our team is working hard on it, and this fun cheering animation made by Drew ""Sandwichtown"" Morgan is an example of that.

Alright, the crazy branch line is done, let's get back to those dark and Irascible champions that's about to come in Ruined King's legendary story.

From Street Gangster to Sentinel of Light

In the last roadmap we briefly mentioned a charming new champion that's about to join the game this summer, a full on Sentinel of Light. Now there are more information we can share, so  we would like to elaborate further.

This champion's identity is a midlane maskman. Although Lucian, Corki and Tristana show up in mid too, but they don't feel like a champion specifically designed for this role, they lack of some common identities of midlane champion, like roaming or solo lane focused kit. We think midlane maskman is an unique role in our champion lineup, and it can attract some players who enjoy midlane assassins or fighters.

Senna and Lucian are in a bad situation here, maybe a new Sentinel can bring them hope.

Living is troublesome sometimes

Yes it does, so does video game development.

Last time we said the new midlane mage will be released before the maskman. But we decided this bad temper Yordle needs more develop time, because we need to use some new technology to make her power sources more believable. Besides, her identity is moving closer from artillery mage to traditional mage. She still is grumpy about those champions bouncing around her, this never changes. This is enough to make her teach a lesson to those champions who run around like a stupid fly.

Even her arrival will be delayed, she still is an important role of Viego's story, after a few months of Runeterra being covered under the shadow, wait till she wakes up and see how she cleans up those messy colors of summoner's rift.

Shape shifting Udyr

Many of you know that Udyr won the VGU vote this year. After that we began the total rework for this spiritual walker. Right now we are still in early stage of development, so there is not dev blog about it separately for now, but it will after a few months.

We would like to share some early concepts of Justin ""RiotEarp"" Albers, see which one resonate more with you.

See You on the Other Side

This article is almost over, when in Viego's legends final stage we would share more contents with you. After this dark story, we must cherry on and welcome our next page of this year. Be ready for the new maskman (for botlane this time) and a glance of the toughest race of Runeterra, no one is more persevering than them.",2021-04-23 21:21:36,1114.0,mwv4h0
8qqtoie,Zellorea,"For those of you who haven't read the translated version of the roadmap (Thank you u/teamalwaysfeeds1) this is what they say at the end regarding the final two champs for the year

""That's it for today's article. There will be more content to share with you when Viego's tale enters the next stage. After experiencing such a gloomy story, we must cheer up and prepare for the next chapter of this year. Ready to welcome the new marskman (this time on the bot lane) and a glimpse of the toughest race in Runeterra, no one will never give more than them.""

The toughest race in Runeterra? To me there's something that *immediately* came to mind when I heard that: Trolls. I'm going to attempt to make a prediction right now, the final champion mentioned (Who is most likely a support) is going to be a troll like Trundle.

Reav3 also said that this years monstrous champion was going to be more humanoid, so to me it'd make sense for them to call the troll champion their monster for the year. 

It's all just theory but with the little info given so far, I think that they are a troll like Trundle.",2021-04-25 01:32:18,7.0,mxonup

ehj550j,Swyft135,"Artillery mages have been performing pretty poorly, being underrepresented in every bracket from low ELO to professional play, and often having subpar win-rates. As a class, they have been struggling for consecutive seasons now, and they have failed to find a proper place in recent metas. We haven't had a class rework in a while, but we could use one right now for Artillery Mages.

&#x200B;

**I. Recent meta shifts, and why they hurt Artillery Mages**:

* The has been an increased prevalence of high-sustain, high-mobility mid laners. Either sustain or mobility is difficult for Artillery Mages to deal with; having both is doubly so. Yone, Yasuo, Viego, etc all heal from waves and can opt to go Vampiric Scepter into Shieldbow.
* There is a strong focus on Drakes and Scuttles, rather than on lanes and sieging. Artillery mages are a lot more adept at playing around towers and lanes, whereas they struggle around rivers and jungle skirmishing.
* Roaming playstyle is still the dominant way to play mid, despite previous changes to the amount of damage Cannon Minions do to towers. Artillery Mages are unable to contest roams from assassins, even when ahead.

**II. Problems with Artillery Mage Itemization in Season 11:**

* Statistically, mage Mythics underperform compared to AD and AP assassin itemization. The mid winrate for completing Everfrost/Luden/Liandry is 50.7% average. Whereas for Eclipse/Duskblade/Prowler's it's 51%, and for NH/Rocketbelt/Riftmaker it's 52.5%. If you exclude Riftmaker for being a bruiser item, then the winrate for NH/Rocketbelt is a staggering 53.1%.
* Artillery mages can no longer turtle the lane by purchasing Seeker's Armguard, due to several nerfs. This not only makes it harder to play against AD mids, but also makes it harder to survive AP assassins like Fizz, against whom Artillery Mages used to build Zhonya's to survive the Ult.
* While Horizon Focus is somewhat strong, it's become too much of a necessary investment for Artillery Mages. This means the first 2 items bought are usually Ludens/Liandrys + HF, which hurts build flexibility. Ex. a Zhonya's second is in general a bad purchase, even against full AD comps, since you cripple yourself by not buying HF, which is where a big part of your viability comes from.
* In previous seasons, Mejai's was how Artillery Mages used to carry despite not having kits built for hard-carrying. However, Mejai got nerfed by 200 gold in S11. Also, it is more difficult to keep stacks, because the survivability of Artillery Mages has been hurt by Zhonya nerfs, and also by the necessity of building Horizon Focus. Classically, you usually paired Mejai's with Zhonya's to avoid getting focused too hard. Now, getting Armguard into Zhonya's is no longer worth it, and it's often more optimal to not upgrade Dark Seal, and buy Horizon Focus instead.

**III. How to probably NOT buff Artillery Mages**

* They don't need buffs to base damage, since that would just encourage them to become supports. Small nerfs to base damage, in exchange for better AP ratios, however, should be helpful (i.e. what they're doing with Xerath).
   * In fact, their damage is honestly fine for the most part.
* They don't need buffs to waveclear. In fact, a couple (like Ziggs) might even need nerfs to their waveclear.
* They don't need buffs in mage matchups, since they tend to do well into those already.
* They don't need more strength when playing from behind. They're alright in this department TBH. Even when losing, if an artillery mage can at least unload their full rotation in a teamfight before dying, they're still doing something. This is partially why artillery mages have been delegated to supports - in a teamfight, it's not horrible to die as a mage support as long as you've dealt your combo.

**IV. Possible ways to buff Artillery Mages**

* Survivability. Artillery mages don't need to beat assassins in lane, but they at least need to survive. A couple artillery mages do alright in this regard (ex. Ziggs and Lux), but others (ex. Vel'Koz) has no innate survivability or reliable CC. Almost all meta midlaners need SOME way of not dying, whether that's mobility/disengage (Vlad, Fizz, Zed, Katarina, Ekko, Ahri, Kassadin, Syndra), tankiness/shields (Galio, Swain, Rumble, Diana, Annie, Ori), or otherwise (Anivia passive, etc).
   * Now that Armguard has been nerfed, a bit more Armor might be nice to have.
* Better carry potential/more volatility. Right now a 0/2 Vel'Koz honestly doesn't feel too different from a 2/0 Vel'Koz, or at least not as different as another champion who goes 0/2 vs 2/0. So in turn it feels like artillery mages can't influence the game strongly even when ahead. Adding carry potential might mean integrating a tiny bit more skill expression into their kit. Or maybe injecting a small amount of snowball or scaling potential - which doubly helps to bring them out of support roles and back into mid.
   * I really like the idea of forcing artillery mages to interact with champions, ex. Xerath mana refund when he auto-attacks champions. It (theoretically) adds a healthy dose of skill expression, and discourages AFK wave-clearing. However, right now, there's the problem that if you're in range to Xerath-auto a Zed, he's in range to 100-0 you.
* Probably some QoL-ish changes. Nicer Q hitbox for Ziggs, Vel’Koz W/E doesn’t disappear on death, etc.

1j11u2st,heldex,"This is the change I thought out. Note how it's exclusively for ISOLATED melee ( can't be abused as melee bot lane since you have a support with you ) and doesn't affect champions that have a melee autoattack range in their kit ( Gnar, Jayce ).

Ranged laners going top has been a thing for entire seasons now and no one likes to play against them.

65v9p1z1,Swrenaa,"Can someone explain why Riot tends to nerf champions that used to be good in the jungle and one or two more roles to the ground untill they are out of the role.

Then as an attempt to widen the jungle pool and making it more favorable, try so hard to make junglers out of those who every one can tell they just don't belong in there.

Like seriously, they complain that Qyiana and Sylas jungle is not healthy for the game, but Darius and Urgot jungle make sense? 
C'mon you look at Qyiana she even feels more like a jungler than a mid laner, mobile, good early game, has cc, can gank efficiently, and more importantly, her passive is literally absorbing 3 types of elements, which is more accessible when roaming in the jungle. Sylas is no different, mobility, scaling, cc, can steal ultimates which is actually more suitable for a jungler, because he roams more and has access to more ultimates, it's not just these, some champions actually feel like junglers, they have what a jungler should have in their kit, like Riven,  Jax, Maokai (he's literally a tree), Shen, Wukong, Camile, or even Twitch IMO, and more..
All these really fit the role, But Riot either nerfed them so hard to be kicked out of the role, or never considered them.
Then instead, they add some absurd damage-to-monster ratios to some champions, to FORCE them into the role they do not belong in. Like C'mon how is a Darius supposed to gank, a Sion, or even Urgot.
 
Of course don't get me wrong, I personally like the fact that they are adding some mages like Morgana and Zyra to the jungle pool, I think it's healthy for the game that you have the option to do so.

But honestly I don't undrestand the controversy of nerfing Camile and Sylas, who were good junglers upon release and actually fit the role, but they are like, No, we Don't like flex picks, and here we are, Darius 500% passive damage to monsters. And some champions have the potential to be awsome junglers, they just need a small push and love, like Jax, or Bard!

Abilities such as Viego W and Vi Q, that have a windup which can be interrupted... why do they have a reduced cooldown if done so? Riot wanted to talk about counterplay for champions but if you're in a fight and see them channeling an ability, which you saved your cc to interrupt them, why should they get less of a punishment? If you played in such a way that you stopped one of their abilities, you should be rewarded instead of a delay. Early on fights can last a long time, but typically only long enough for one cast, but the reduced cooldown means they can still get the cast off in the fight. In my opinion no abilities should receive a break if the enemy managed to counter it, especially not a 60% refund on cooldown",2021-04-25 01:18:22,5.0,mxodt4

Many games people will complain about face checking bushes or getting ganked deep in our jungle due to no vision out. But it just seems extremely difficult especially in bronze to work a map with vision. Many other players won’t properly ward and then I’m at the mercy of my two yellows and pinks with the revealing plant to clear out enemy wards.

I get my one pink and then have to sit there and wait for my red ward to come off CD each time to clear out vision and traps but by the time it’s up they already have more traps and vision down AND I’m stuck with the red ward so the ONLY ward I provide my team is that one pink , feels frustrating as fk.

But I want to iterate the very important fact that any elo where you’re peaking and needing to grow is your “high elo” and these issues become relevant to you, as you’re trying to grow and learn to apply new skills. 

As LS says, when you’re trying to learn and improve, “a teamcomp shouldn’t be like you’re ready to blow your brains out.” As long as you’re trying to increase your skills and grow past your peak, it doesn’t matter whether it’s Diamond or Silver, draft matters, both champs and teammates.

But what do all of these issues have in common? Why do they matter and why do they cause dodges? Why is League harder to rationally play today than S5-6? I feel like there’s 2 answers. 

**The first answer** is that the game has become so refined and meticulous over the years that small deficiencies begin to be exponentially more important as time has gone on. For example, the average mid Silver player today would probably have enough game knowledge to be Gold or Plat in S2-3. The average Diamond player would probably have been Challenger. I feel like this is why a lot of players get hard stuck — they are able to learn and grow with their peers, but not faster than them. Each year, every tier gains a little more knowledge and skill. This makes the problems in bad drafts worse, and magnifies small issues like having too many magic damage champs or not having enough hard CC, or having too many lanes with unfavorable matchups. Every player in every tier who has played for more than 1 season has taken their knowledge with them into the next season, and with it, raised the knowledge floor of that tier. This makes high elo an *extremely refined and sensitive* place to play.

**The second answer** is that Riot keeps destroying ways for single players to influence the game, in the name of balance. Jungle has been especially gutted in Season 11, where 30 of the worst 50 champs to play from behind are Junglers. Many of them lose 20% winrate by just being -2 deaths at 10 minutes. 20%!!! Games today are often decided by advantages at 5-10 minutes, or even in draft, because there’s just no way at all to play from a disadvantageous position unless the enemy team are complete apes. Riot has removed powerful items like Zz’Rot, Ohmwrecker, Frozen Mallet, Rod of Ages, Tracker’s Knife, Poacher’s Knife, and has rebalanced others, because they were too powerful or too niche. But these items fulfilled a niche, and needed rebalanced, not removed or gutted. 

Today, the item shop has fewer options than it has ever had, and players have virtually no way to itemize or gain the upper hand when behind. All of the items are extremely basic and simple, and the game comes down to “who has the most gold” rather than “who has the most wit”. 

There are virtually no catchup mechanics, and if a player feels as though they cannot influence a match, of course they’ll dodge! Or if they’re in a match and fall too far behind to be relevant, they may troll or grief or just build bruiser Sivir. 

**There are no options at all for influencing a match while in a very unfavorable situation, such as facing a hard counter or being behind or having a bad draft.** This problem is magnified by the first problem, where advantages and disadvantages become more refined every season as net playerbase skill and knowledge increase year by year.

What’s the solution?

**Redesign Draft** to allow players to begin each game by establishing the same semblance of control over their experience as they had in Season 7, when 10 bans was first introduced. Since then, about 20 new champions have been added, not including VGUs. Each draft could ban up to 7.4% of the champ pool, and each laner had about 6.5% control over their matchup (assuming 30 champs per lane and 1 unique ban and 1 unique pick). Today, each draft can ban up to 6.4% of the champ pool and each laner has about 5% control. If each team got 2 more bans, draft could ban up to 9% of the champ pool. If math is correct, allowing 2 extra bans would bump the average control of each laner over draft up to 6%.

Here’s how you do it, updated tournament draft:
1. At the beginning of each draft, everyone shows champion intent like normal.
2. Then, first ban phase. The first 2 players on each team get 2 bans each for 4 total bans per team.
3. Then, first pick phase. They lock their champs.
4. Then, second ban phase. The next 3 players on each team ban 1 champ each.
5. Then, second pick phase. They lock their champs.

This gives each individual player and each collective team the ability to gain more control and preparation for the match than the current system allows, without giving them total dominance or the ability to outright rig matches. This would return draft to a similar state of health to Season 7, when 10-ban draft was first introduced. This would encourage players to think critically about draft phase and give them options to overcome unfavorable circumstances, other than hostage taking or dodging.

**Reintroduce Old Items** updated for modern context. Items which allowed individual players to gain a tactical advantage even when playing from behind or when playing with a team that is obviously outmatched or trolling. Items like Zz’Rot Portal and Tracker’s Knife can be reintroduced with conditions for purchase or performance that change based on match conditions. For example, Zz’Rot’s spawn could have their level based on an equation such as (spawn level) = (1/(average team level))*100, maximum 10, purchasable only at level 10 or higher. This would make the item strongest when the team is at a level disadvantage. 

Tracker’s Knife could be reiterated as a 3rd Jungle starter item, granting the player +1 extra ward limit and 50% reduced Trinket cooldown could even grant Blasting Smite (Smite which deals lower AoE damage in addition to normal damage from a previous season) at an increased charge requirement (perhaps 7 smites instead of 5). This would give Junglers an option to play a safer game when disadvantaged, something which is currently almost impossible to do in any elo.

Rod of Ages was one the only items in the game which had a low cost AND ramping rewards for buying it, ensuring that a player could afford to build it when behind and eventually benefit from it if they stayed safe long enough for it to kick in. It should be reintroduced and Frozen Mallet should be reiterated as the AD version, exactly the same way: a cheap, inefficient item affordable to players who are behind which eventually becomes efficient.

**Create Deficit Insurance**

This can be done by adding an extra rune category where you choose one of 4 options:
- At 15 minutes or level 10, gain 18-1% bonus damage based on level (decreasing)
- At 15 minutes or level 10, gain 18-1% bonus XP based on level (decreasing)
- At 15 minutes or level 10, gain 18-1% damage resistance based on level (decreasing)
- At 15 minutes or level 10, gain 9.5-0% extra gold based on level (decreasing)

Or to force a player to pay for this insurance, potions with these effects could be added to the shop. A player could be able to purchase one potion, only one time, beginning at 10 minutes. Players may choose to buy one or not, but anyone who is at a disadvantage will get more benefit than someone who is already at an advantage. 

There could even be an added “Insurance Shop” which opens up after 10 minutes and offers the above, as well as items to change your smite or switch damage types or gain ramping bonuses (Rod of Ages, Poacher’s Knife, etc.) 

Items or effects such as these could give players who are behind a second chance to regain influence over a match, despite griefers and AFKs or unfavorable circumstances.

These suggestions aren’t perfect and were dreamt up by a Silver player in just a few minutes, ***but at least they’re something***, and Riot’s world-class professional design team and bronze-to-challenger internal feedback team should be able to team up and refine these ideas or come up with better ones, but we haven’t seen any such improvements in 4+ years. I feel like they’re not even trying.

And that’s why Dodging is an issue today — the game has become extremely unforgiving and unhealthy to play at a disadvantage, so it’s best to just not play if you think you’re at a disadvantage. From the mouths of legendary pros and challenger level coaches.",2021-04-25 01:55:28,3.0,mxp4uj

Hello everyone,

It has been a long time since we officially started the return of the Ruined King in the last road map. Although there isn't much new information to share with you, there are indeed many updates to the content announced at the beginning of this year.

In January, we said that the three champions after Viego will also be related to his return. Gwen is one of them, but her future is still a mystery. She played an important role in this complicated story, but what exactly it is...we don't know yet.

Let’s pause the discussion about Viego, Gwen, and the Ruination for a moment. First, we'll take a look at Dr. Mundo’s VGU. Then we'll talk about the next two new champions, including the an update on the release date for the mysterious mage. Finally, we'll discuss Udyr's VGU, which was selected at the beginning of the year.

**Enter the world of Mundo**

It’s been a while since Mundo’s [previous blog](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-the-latest-on-dr-mundo-s-vgu/) (this link is in English), and now we can finally say that the Zaun Madman will soon meet with you again. Thank you for your patience *(this champion has too many skins)*.

First, let's share some of Mundo's new lines. Mundo's new voiceover sounds a little smarter than the current Mundo—this is almost inevitable, because Mundo's current lines can’t tell that he is a ""doctor"", let alone reflect his choice of treatment. They are even less likely to reflect the reasoning *(although this is very suspicious)* process when he chooses the treatment plan. But we have also mentioned before that we want to retain Mundo's dark and comical *(...and very silly)* personality, and his voice acting is an important part of it.

Another piece of content we want to share before the official release is the final version of the concept art of the Rageborn Mundo. In the previous dev blog, we showed the finalized concept art of this skin, and now the skin is finished.

<image of concept art of Rageborn Mundo>      


Finally his legendary skin, Corporate Mundo, also entered the final stage of polishing. We want to ensure that this skin meets the current quality standards and expectations of legendary skins. The team members are working hard in development on this. This funny animation produced by Drew ""Sandwichtown"" Morgan to boost morale illustrates this point well.

<[gif](https://twitter.com/SkinSpotlights/status/1385602797048107009) of Corporate Mundo in a tiny red sports car zooming around a flat plane>

Okay, this crazy section is over, let's return to the dark and grumpy champions.

**From street urchin to sentinel**

In the roadmap for the 2021 season, we briefly mentioned a charming new hero, the Sentinel of Light who will join the rift this summer. Now there is more content available for sharing, which can be said in more detail.

The role of this champion is a mid lane marksman. Although champions such as Lucian, Corki, and Tristana also appear in mid lane, they are not similar to champions designed for this position. They lack some common characteristics of mid champions, such as specially designed roaming methods and (something I couldn't figure out). We think that the mid lane marksman can not only add a unique champion to the lineup, but also attract many players who like to use mid lane assassins or guerrilla fighters (bruisers?).

Senna and Lucian are in a very bad situation right now, but there may be a new sentry to give them hope again.

**Life is really troublesome sometimes**

Yes, it is true, and so is video game development.

Last time we said that the new mage in the middle will be released before the marksman. Since then, we decided that this new grumpy Yordle needs more research and development time, because new technology needs to be adopted to make her source of power more visually convincing. In addition, with the development of her gameplay, she has gradually moved from an artillery mage to a traditional mage. She would still be furious at those mobile champions running and dashing around her, and that hasn't changed in the slightest. This is enough for her to show her true ability and give a good lesson to all the guys who smirk and run around like flies.

Despite the postponed release, the champion will still play an important role in Viego's story. After watching her in the shadows of Runeterra for a few months, he finally decided to get up and clean up all the messy colors of Summoner's Rift.

**Udyr**

Many people know that Udyr won the vote for the player visual gameplay update held at the beginning of this year. Then we began to prepare a complete redo for the spirit walker. The current research and development is still in its early stages, so we don't have enough to publish an article for this, but there should be enough in a few months.

We also want to share a few sketches drawn by Justin ""RiotEarp"" Albers to see which one can resonate more.

<image of sketches of Udyr>      


See you on the Rift.

That's it for today's article. There will be more content to share with you when Viego's tale enters the next stage. After experiencing such a gloomy story, we must cheer up and prepare for the next chapter of this year. Ready to welcome the new marskman *(this time on the bot lane)* and a glimpse of the toughest race in Runeterra, no one will never give more than them.

69pu0es5,Konny66,"So we all know League is a love or hate relationship, but the game itself is not that bad, I do say I really enjoy it for about 9-10 years now. We all get tilted we all get salty at some point, thats normal I do get that, its a competetive game. Since season 5 I have been witnessing a steady increase of toxicity and it gets worse with every upcomming season. I am slowly starting to not enjoy the game anymore, not because its not fun, but of its community.  


So I just want to discuss, where does all the hate come from?  


Take my last game for example, I have turned of both chats, typed not a single thing and for some reason, got insulted (like seriously f.e. ""subhuman"" etc) by the enemy team, yes not even my own team said anything at all. Reason was the playstyle I had the usual splittin but then again, I checked their ranks, gold, plat 4 at max. I peaked diamond 2 and im diamond every season... There are people 2 leagues below you, trying to teach you the game that they cant even play themselves... It was a chilled normal game.  


I feel like, nowdays, its only about ""report person x"" after the end of every game. Some run it down, some rage quit and when even normal games tend to be corrupted by that shit... Like you cant even play a single day league without a full premade team or you will just get flamed shit talked what so ever. What are your thought?",2021-04-25 05:58:53,1.0,mxu103

7es6t37m,fellprince,"ARAM has been my most played mode for a while and even though some people underestimate or don't even give a sh\* to how nice a good aram game might be, i think we should bring its balance to discussion more often.

A few many paths ago, in 2019 if i'm not mistaken, riot put a lot of effort in making aram a better mode for everyone. Most changes were pretty good such as the timed redemptions across the bridge, and some other adjustments in champ base damage both dealt and taken helped make the game viable for some late game/hard kit champions. However, it seems to me that there is a niche of champions that has been unfairly capped by riot at its peak when compared to others. So, I'd like to be enlightened by more experienced people on this special case:

After many matches played with different champs from different roles, there is one core thing in these whole new riot balance criteria i can't still understand: why do some brutal bursting ap build champs such as lux are so massive nerfed when compared to others much more difficult to counter such as ap malphite?

Let me clarify my question. I'm not here to say lux should be buffed in aram, what i can't quite grasp is why we should have an actual mage champ being less successful in the mage role, which means having good cc skills and casting spells to deal tons of damage but being squishy and if badly played easily killed, while champs who are originally meant to play other roles can do what mages are supposed to do but even better and still somewhat keep some of their innate advantages such as bigger base hp, move speed etc, like malphite.

Lux is nerfed not only in damage dealt to enemy champions and minions, but also takes more damage than usual, while some people would say that maphite becomes a point and click killing machine after reaching lv6.

Please, help me understand how this could be healthy.",2021-04-25 05:45:04,0.0,mxtrdi
8y3ao0xn,CallMe_Goose,"General rule of thumb I go by when in soloQ
If you’re playing top, your jungler is the dumbest person in the game.
If you’re playing jungle, your top laner is the dumbest person in the game.
If you’re midlane, everyone’s and idiot.
If you’re adc, your support is the dumbest person in the game.
If you’re support, your adc is the dumbest person in the game.

People don’t like to play tanks/enchanters because then they have to leave the “carrying” up to someone else, and let’s be real everyone in your game is an idiot.

Every Yasuo on your team ints. Every Yasuo on the enemy team 1v9s this is the same for Akali, Katarina, Irellia, jg Nidalee, Master Yi, Riven, Vayne, Ezreal, Zyra and Brand.

The enemy teams top laner is a tank, or a good frontline champ, while yours is Quinn, Teemo, Vayne, or Lucian.

Nobody understands how to draft a comp. Full ad comp with mid being last pick. Locks in Yasuo, Yone, Zed, or Talon.

Your mid Fizz, TF, Talon, Akali, Katarina or LB can’t roam at all. TF ults to get back to lane, Talon hasn’t put a point in E and he’s level 6.

Neither top or mid can look at their minimap, contest a skuttle crab, or rotate for an objective.

Your adc either can’t cs or can’t team fight. It’s one or the other. Or if you’re really lucky, it’s both. And you think they’ll follow up if you engage a fight? HA what a joke.

Your support Leona, Alistar, Rakan, Pantheon, or Sett are terrified of the enemy, so much that they’re standing at turret while your trying to farm.

Your support Janna heard of the guy who made diamond by only using Janna E. But, they only use it on themselves. You thought Janna was going to ult to save you/heal you? WRONG flash in and ult the 18/2 Nasus with 5k stacks right onto your face.

Your support Yuumi is actually in the bathroom playing wildrift on their phone.

You can 1v9 a game but that support zyra that has pen boots will out damage everyone by 60k damage.

Your adc Vayne, Lucian, Ezreal, Kalista, or anyone with gale force will dash into the blitz pull, or thresh hook.

Your Varus can’t even Q the minions in his face let alone land an ult.

Your Zilean, lulu or Kayla will never ult you.

You don’t have a top laner if it’s Nasus, Yorick, Illaoi, or Tryndamere. They’ll have 400 cs at 20 minutes though.

Nobody respects your calls. 19 enemy players bot lane, but that baron call is horrible. Despite you all already in the baron pit.

Nobody understands objectives. That guy top lane when dragons being contested and he doesn’t have tp. He walks all the way to dragon pit rather than pushing top to inhib.

Your top laner will die level 2 tp back, and will die again. Then buy boots, run back and die a 3rd time.

Your adc doesn’t want to recall ever, they just want the shop to come to them. Sitting on 7.5k gold, gotta get that half of a turret plate.

Your support is top lane even though you’re level 4 and mirrored a recall. They’re refusing to come back to lane until you get turret dove by 3 people. But if you say anything they rage and refuse to come back to lane. Then bitch when you have 75 cs at 25 minutes and have died 4 times.

Shen will always have his ult up and will save the enemy. However yours is ulting the full health TF when he starts ulting because teleporters go brr.

Everyone can play your champion better than you. They know EVERY mechanic even if they have never played the champion before.

Your teammate is never wrong. And, if they are. You should keys, hard R, terminal cancer, frogget, cry more, tri hard.

Your jungler will never gank, they’ll just be playing pve. But not for dragons, dragons are spooky.

Or, your jungler will invade, die, invade again, die, invade again, and uh die. Then they afk.

Your mid lane will be down 15-200 cs while the enemy mid lane is living bot lane, they have a nice little tent set up in the alcove. It’s nice, little camp fire and shit. But at least they’re getting the turret right? No. It’s full hp. In fact I think it gained health.

And second of all. I cant remember 1 good team around the world that picked Jhin. He was clearly a very bad choice in the meta and shouldnt even be allowed to be picked from the Coaching staff to begin with imo.

W: Empower (New) (6 second cooldown; 50 mana)

Passive: Jax's basic attacks on-hit grant a stack for 2.5 seconds, stacking up to 2 times, and refreshing the duration on subsequent attacks.

9btdzht4,ShodanCyberMinion,"Imagine owning every skin and being a fan of a champ for over 9 years.  
And no one cares about your feedback and acts like your not a fan.

They just take a wild guess what the fans want and we should be happy even tho were actually not. were ignored and our needs are also.  


As a matter as a fact i think at this point i should not have to pay for stuff that was made without the care or focus on the champion.  
Often ignoring details where pointed out but ignoring when changes are made that were un needed.  
A good example would be people arguing a jacket being a part of a characters look.  
But at the same time deleting details on other champs with new skins utterly being a giant hypocrite and fundamentally lying to me, yourself and the player base.

i'm honestly trying to be very calm and kind but i think riot needs to stop telling players what they want.",2021-04-25 14:49:23,0.0,my2rf8

Its really negitive and makes the tone of the stream really bad till the next game is about to start.

b2mugry6,Shadowbasherr,"From the discussion of dodging over the last few days it seems there is a wierd sense of entitlement among players in League, that they think they should be entitled to win every game, and that losing a game is a waste of their time.

You can see this in games when someone types ""why no please go next this is a waste of everyones time"" when the ff vote is denied when you are 2 kills behind at 15.

People seem to have this wierd idea that they should just win every game and be allowed to just chain dodge repeatedly with 0 punishment in order to stack the deck in their favour as much as possible to get the perfect team comp

Edit - for the record I believe there is a complete difference between ""ok my top laner has janna with smite to force a dodge and is going to troll if i don't"" companed to ""damn the enemy team looks better than ours, oh well nvm time to dodge and only lose LP which doesnt matter anyway""",2021-04-24 18:57:23,5.0,mxho8t

8snwnb7l,xvhayu,"At the moment league is just completely unbalanced in every way, there are just too many interactions in the game right now that make it feel bad to play. The main problem right now is movement speed, mainly on tanks and bruisers.

For context, I am a League player since season 5, I study game design, and I have peaked Diamond 2 42LP on EUW, just to prove that my opinion isn't completely uneducated. Obviously that won't stop others from disagreeing with me, and I'm not saying you should agree with me in every way, but I believe I'm not someone who doesn't deserve to be heard at all.

# Remove movement speed from some items (and/or runes)

Right now, there just is too much movement speed in the game.

List of Items with Movespeed:

* Turbo Chemtank (+60% upon activating effect)
* Dead Man's Plate (+5%, + up to 60 based on charge)
* Force of Nature (+5%, +8 per stack, up to 40)
* Death's Dance (+30% on takedown)
* Black Cleaver (+5 per stack, up to 30)
* Wit's End (+20 on attack)
* Stridebreaker (+30 on attack)
* Trinity Force (+25 on attack, +3 through mythic passive)
* Blade of the Ruined King (+25% upon activating effect)
* Eclipse (+15% upon activating effect)
* Youmuu's Ghostblade (+40 out of combat, +20% upon activating effect)
* Galeforce (+3% through mythic passive)
* All Zeal Items (+7%, doubled for Phantom Dancer upon activating effect)
* Mercurial Scimitar (+50% upon activating effect)
* Hextech Rocketbelt & Night Harvester (+30%/+25% upon activating effect)
* Luden's Tempest (+15% upon activating effect)
* Lich Bane (+10%)
* Cosmic Drive (+10-30 based on level, if above 160 AP)
* Mejai's Soulstealer (+10% while above 10 stacks)
* Imperial Mandate (+20% upon activating effect)
* Shurelya's Battlesong (+60% for whole team upon activating effect)
* Knight's Vow (+35% towards bound ally, if they are below 50% HP)
* Vigilante Wardstone (+10%)

Now that is a LONG list. And let's not forget that summoner spells (Ghost, Heal, Teleport) and runes (Predator, Phase Rush, Fleet Footwork, Nimbus Cloak, Celerity, Waterwalking, Relentless Hunter, Magical Footwear, Approach Velocity, Time Warp Tonic) exist.

Now, the problem with this are not the individual items or runes, but the stacking of those effects. An Udyr with only Turbo Chemtank would not be #1 jungler, but an Udyr with Turbo Chemtank, Chilling Smite, Phase Rush, Nimbus Cloak, Celerity, Waterwalking, and Dead Man's Plate/Force of Nature/Lich Bane coming on his next item slots is definitely one fast man in a bear suit.

Also, the items are obviously not all equal. Movement speed on Mercurial Scimitar's active effect is not nearly as strong as movement speed on Dead Man's Plate.

At the beginning of the season everyone was complaining about how almost every class had access to a dash now, but those small dashes don't mean anything at all if there are item combinations that give you a permanent Zilean E.

Right now, movement speed is reduced at certain thresholds, [here](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Movement_speed#Movement_speed_caps) is a link to the LoLWiki page. With the reworked items, though, that is just simply not enough anymore.

My suggestion would be to further nerf stacking of Movespeed (by making additional Movespeed scale less), and/or to nerf certain numbers or remove certain effects entirely. For example, I don't see much of a problem with removing Winged Moonplate and its 5% effect on Dead Man's Plate and Force of Nature entirely.

# Rework Immortal Shieldbow

At the moment, Shieldbow is too powerful on solo laners, while it makes ADCs trade a lot of damage for the privilege to survive one burst. The main candidate I'm talking about here is Yone, but things like Yasuo, Irelia, and Corki also benefit from Shieldbow to an extent that shouldn't be allowed.

The main difference between solo laners and ADCs is obviously the level disparity. And since the shield from Immortal Shieldbow scales with levels, this obviously matters a lot. The shield scales from 300 to 800, from level 9 to 18, so about +55 shield per level. So until the ADC is level 18, a solo laner will have \~110 more shield value from Immortal Shieldbow in an average game, where the solo laner is 2 levels above the ADC. Furthermore, the item's users can snowball even harder, because the further ahead they are, the bigger their shield is, while ADCs that fall back and have to buy defensively profit the least from the item.

Additionally, the flat Lifesteal value from Immortal Shieldbow benefits Yone (and others) a LOT. Yone goes from a vulnerable melee mid laner to an unpokeable sustain monster as soon as he hits Vampiric Scepter (and some more AD). Irelia obviously has the same kind of problem with Blade of the Ruined King, but in my opinion it is much more balanced to rush a BotRK for Lifesteal instead of a mythic.

So, in my opinion, Immortal Shieldbow needs two changes:

1. Don't let levels make such an impact on the value of the item (maybe make it scale per minute of gametime, not too easy to find a good base here)
2. Replace flat Lifesteal with HP (or other stat), and make Lifesteal the mythic passive (thinking about \~4-5%)

# Fix Senna

Even though Senna was intended to be a Support, she is basically unplayable as a traditional support right now. The item rework just absolutely shattered that role.

Senna is completely fine as an ADC, or as a fasting Carry with a tank or something else, but not as a traditional support of an actual ADC. She has no good items that she can build, and she basically offers nothing to peel or help an ADC.

Without creating a specific mythic item just for Senna, there is basically only one option: make Senna convert certain stats from support items into stats that she can use better. For example, she could convert Mana Regeneration into AD. This would open up all Support item options for her, and I can't think of anything that would be considered OP.

Another problem Senna has, or rather enemies facing Senna have, is her infinitely scaling range. Kindred also has infinite range, but Senna has higher range at level 1, and scales much faster and more consistent. I don't think this is balanced and needs a change.

One possibility would be to make Range scale with levels, maybe 600/625/650/675 at lvl 1/6/11/16. If it's just a flat amount per level, it would overlap with Tristana's passive.",2021-04-26 20:45:27,0.0,mywtpk

Another one used to be Elise- she would build some AP items and itemize tanky, because her base values were good.

17fsmnke,TherealClinger2,"So I’m playing LOL and I am getting to the point where my team has a very good lead against the other team. The other team knows this, so they (as in four of them) decide to go under tower. My team is trying to push into the tower with our creeps, but for the most part both teams are trading creeps. At this point we are “dancing” with each other getting close to tower and backing off of tower. 

This is where the item I would like to propose comes in. I would like to propose a item that only does one thing and that is to disable a tower for around five seconds. The item would cost like 2,000g and can only be purchased by one person on the team and has a cool down of 5min or once the item is used you can not use it again.

I know Bard has his ult which can make towers immune to taking damage. But I want something that disables a tower. I think it will speed games up and allow the winning team to not have to wait an extra ten minutes to win while the “dancing” phase happens every game.",2021-04-26 15:07:03,1.0,myrt74

The noob goes top with Darius and does whatever he can to survive. 

Our Master player plays random stuff like nunu mid with constant ganks since lvl 1 at other lanes(this gets hilarious).

Our jungler usually plays in-meta stuff. 

Me and another one always play random stuff in botlane like Janna-Udyr, Janna-Anivia, Janna-Cho-gath (Im main Janna as you can see), Malphite-Chogath, Poppy-Anivia... and such.

8kqb2,molenzwiebel,"Hey everyone! We're happy to announce that we're participating in the launch of reddit's newest feature: Prediction Tournaments! We'll be using them to set up a large prediction tournament for MSI, with grand prizes available for the top predictors.

### What are predictions?

Predictions are a way for us to create polls with rewards. We'll be creating a prediction for every MSI game, and you will be able to vote on who you think will win the match.

To participate in a prediction, you need to bet some of your tournament tokens. Everyone starts with 1000 tokens and can bet 10, 30 or 100 tokens on their choice. All bet tokens are combined in a shared pool and distributed among the players that chose the winning vote. If you guess correctly, you'll end up with more tokens than you started with. Guessed wrong? Those tokens are gone.

The only way to get tournament tokens is by winning a prediction. You can't buy them with coins or ask us to gift you some. Once you're out, you're out.

### Prediction Tournaments

Predictions have been out on /r/Predictor for a while now already, but the real new feature is prediction tournaments. All of our MSI predictions will be part of a single large tournament, and your tokens are shared between all of them. To make the predictions a bit more exciting, there's also a [leaderboard](https://i.imgur.com/XaZusV4.png) which shows the best predictors on the sub. We have some fancy rewards for those that manage to amass the most tokens.

### Prizes

The three best predictors at the end of MSI, as shown on the leaderboard of the prediction tournament will be given some prizes. In particular:

- First place: **Ternion All-Powerful Award** (5,000 coins, 6 months of reddit premium)
- Second place: **Argentium Award** (2,500 coins, 3 months of reddit premium)
- Third place: **Platinum Award** (700 coins, 1 month of reddit premium)

We'll also give you a special predictor expert flair, to show off next to your name for years to come!

### Details

One prediction thread will be created for each regularly scheduled match. You will be able to vote on who you think will win the match **up until the first match of the day starts**. In order to prevent spoilers, we will only reveal the winner either 24 hours after the match has finished, or at the start of the next match day, whichever is sooner.

Only regularly scheduled matches will be included. Potential tiebreakers will not receive a prediction thread. For best-of series, a single prediction will be created for the entire series (regardless of whether a team wins 3-0 or 3-2).

**Links to the prediction threads will be posted in the live discussion threads, as well as a central megathread. All predictions will also be listed on the prediction tournament page** (if you're on new reddit, there should be a tab on the main page saying ""Predictions"").

The predictions tournament feature is primarily supported on reddit mobile apps and new reddit. You will be able to vote on predictions on old reddit, but you may need to switch to new reddit to see the leaderboard.

13vqax,ohvalox,"Hey everyone! As promised, I'm here with yet another announcement: We are introducing community awards!

There are some amazing artists and creatives in this community, so [we want to include your ideas with a contest](https://imgur.com/a/Hh5rv7V).

Everyone can submit designs, and the community will have the chance to vote on their favorites. The most popular ones will be included. Reddit was kind enough to sponsor some prizes, so the creators of the Top 5 submissions will be rewarded with a mod-only award, which includes a month of Reddit Premium.

[Check out this announcement from Reddit for more details on community awards.](https://redd.it/chdx1h) When you buy awards for something on here, the subreddit gets ""Community coins"", which we can use to hand out mod-only awards that give Reddit Premium.

We are therefore looking for two categories of awards: One that can be bought by everyone, and one only for mods.

For the normal one, you are pretty free, so you can be as creative as you want. Some possibilities could be: Iron, Challenger, GG/stayed cool/shotcalling honors, Crowd control, Emotes, Mastery, Pentakill... whatever you like, the possibilities are endless!

We want to use the Moderator-Only awards as a kind of ""Mod's choice award"" to honor extraordinary contributions to the subreddit. Of course, we need something special for that. Maybe the League icon, Honor 5 or the Summoner's Cup? Just some examples so you know our thought process, but you are again not limited by these ideas.

---

Here's how the contest works:

* All submissions must go in the submission thread (this post). Submissions will be open for one week
* We will collect them and create a separate thread to vote. Voting will last 4 days
* Submissions must abide by subreddit rules, reddit rules, be SFW, and related to league
* No team awards (e.g. MAD, C9, DK)
* No GIFs.
* Width and height should be equal, and at least 512px, file size is limited to 2MB


There's no defined number of awards that will be added, since we don't know how everything will go.

We hope you like it and we are excited for your submissions!",2021-05-01 18:00:26,8.0,n2fd1j

Hi all guys, i dont know if you already knew about (probably) next jungle changes (put sauces on top) but i'd like to discuss about it with you all

First of all let's point out the main changes

**Changes**

\- Easier clears, less dmg from monsters, a little more of gold but an higher respawn time

\- Smite, Less Omnivamp but more healing from smaiting and now it breaks scuttle shield (before dmg application)

**Reduce Snowballing**

\- XP Comeback, if you are behind you should gain more exp from large monsters

\- Smite dmg flat, now it deals 500 at the beginning and 1k when completed the quest (no scaling anymore)

\- Camp leash indicator, in the future when leasing a particle will appear to show max monster leash range

**Context**

Ok so these change are made to help new players in the jungle, couse we know this role have serious troubles in low elo and it is ""hard-to-do""  at the beginning of the game for new people

**Question**

Are these changes really ""OK"" for helping new jungler players?

**IMHO**

For me it is not and it is not fair for experienced junglers

Let me explain:

**1** \- Ok you help with clear but you add some time to respawn and what it means? that junglers (probably) have to tax more or to invest time in invading or ganking. It could be OK if we are speaking about exp player that know (more or less xD) what they do

In this way (also) you could bring again in the game the gank meta with only hard CC's champ that spend a lot of time in ganking and taxes OR you could shift the meta to champ that plays  aggressively that try to get ahead in early stages of the game

That for new players IMHO is not healthy couse it requires a lot of knowledge

**2** \- Smite changes are really meh to me because the flat dmg open up to some deep changes in the jungle economy:

\- For example nunu could at lvl 7 (if i dont mind) do drake with 1700 True dmg on it (dont get me wrong i love disco nunu), or Choggy with R+Smite combo

Or

\- Ok you remove scuttle's shield with your smite, but if you burn it to do faster the scuttle and then the enemy jungler come to contest you are smiteless for 15s and 90/100 you lose it (i dont even mention PRIO in lanes, no one will help you xD). As i said only champ with hard CC's will benefit about it (just thing about Elise)

**3** \- Snowballing

Ok lets be honest, we all get mad when the enemy goes ahead and carry the game but it is part of the game.

If you know how to play and you are really good in your role, you must be rewarded. If i go x/0/x with 2lvl on enemy jungle i must have some advantage on him.

Now with flat smite you dont have more smiting power that means he can steal it as well with a huge lvl gap

It seems now that if the enemy is behind he can just farm and he can comeback at your level, for me is not fair couse as jungler i have to spend a lot of effort again in invading and in aggressively play (always keeping in mind i dont get punished by enemy team)

We go always in the same direction, those mechanics are not handy for new players and not even fair for exp ones

(i dont mention kills lead couse we all know it depens also about your team and the enemy team comp etcetc)

&#x200B;

Thats just my opinion, im curious about yours...what do you think about these changes?

3nnl7rna,EvilSwarak,"I don't see any on-hit ADC's building on-hit items anymore. Reason is simple - on-hit is weaker than crit.

So my solution for this is to make Rageblade mythic. My idea is something like this:

#  Guinsoo's Rageblade:

* **50 AD**
* **50% AS**
* **5% Movement speed**
* **Passive:** *Every 3rd hit apply on-hit effects 2x. Rageblade gives you bonus 40-200 (*based on level) *bonus magic dmg*
* **Unique Passive (Guinsoo's weapon):** Every 3rd hit gives you 10-45% attack speed steroid for 3 seconds. 
* **Mythic passive:** 2,5% bonus True dmg for every Legendary item.

Something like this comes to my mind. I think it's great option for on-hit ADC's such as Kog'maw, Kai'sa, Varus, Ashe or Vayne who rather build on-hit than crit. Also it gives ADC'S more item diversity.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***As for on-hit items buffs ,Blade of the Ruinded King (BOTRK) and Wits End needs some love.***

#  Blade of the Ruined King

* **40 AD**
* **35% AS**
* **15% Lifesteal**
* **Passive**: Basic attacks deals bonus Physical dmg (12% for melee/ 10% for ranged)
* **Unique Active (500 range) (90 seconds cooldown)**: Instantly deals 120-360 (based on level) magic dmg, slows enemy by 35% and Marks them.  If you hit marked enemy, you get True sight of them and deal 5% more dmg to them.

***By giving it 500 range I wanted to give ''reward'' to ranged champions for playing more aggresive.***

&#x200B;

# Wit's End

* **50% AS**
* **50 MR**
* **5% Movement speed**
* **Passive:** Basic attacks deals 20-100 bonus Magic damage. When you are below 50% HP heals you for (100% melee /  33% ranged) of this effect's post-mitigation damage. 
* **Unique Passive (Last Breath)**: When you drop below 20% HP you can activate Wit's End and enchant your next 3 auto to give you small shield (30-90 per auto attack).

***I wanted to make Wit's End as...well...wit's end. This item gives you some sustain when you are at low HP, so you can survive little bit longer and deal more dmg.***

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***More on-hit dmg items:***

# Hextech Rifle H69 (Hybrid on-hit item)

* **80 AD**
* **60 AP**
* **25% AS**
* **10 AH**
* **Passive - Enchanted Bulets (AD users):** 25% of your total AD is converted to Magic dmg, 75% is Physical dmg
* **Passive - Advanced Technique (AP users)** : 25% of your total AP is converted to Physical dmg, 75% is Magic dmg
* **Unique passive:** ''Enchanted bullets'' and ''Advanced Technique'' procs only on auto attacks (or Azir's soldiers) as bonus on-hit dmg 

***I wanted to give champions that like both AP and AD stats (Jax, Shyvana, Azir, Teemo, Kayle, Sylas (?) and many more) some item that they would like to build.***

&#x200B;

# Lunari's Silver blade (AP on-hit item)

* **70 AP**
* **40% AS**
* **20% AH**
* **Passive:** If you have over 200 AP empowers your auto attacks with 10% magic dmg and physical penetration and gives you 30-100 bonus physical dmg

***This item gives you some combat power. Difference between Nashor's Tooth is physical dmg as on-hit and some AH, but less AP.***

&#x200B;

# Empowered Tri-Crossbow (ADC on-hit item)

* **30 AD**
* **30% AS**
* **30 AH**
* **5% Movement speed**
* **Passive - Triple shot:** Every 3rd auto attack shoots 3 autos instead of 1 ,but they deal 25% less dmg than auto attack (apply on-hit dmg).

***Idea that came to my head.***

Since then, he has not played at an international event. No All-Stars. No Worlds. No MSI. No Rift Rivals. He has only played domestically.

Now, he's playing at MSI. I believe he's one of only two players from Worlds 2014 who will be playing at this MSI. And all of the others from the event who are still active, all have been to international events except for him. I believe the only others left are: Gillius, Svenskeren, WildTurtle, Rekkles, Deft, FabFabulous, and HolyPhoenix (who will also be at MSI), all of whom have played internationally since.

Awesome to see that he's stuck with it and has found a way to get back to the international stage after 6.5 years. I'll be rooting for him.",2021-05-01 17:07:32,13.0,n2epot
28713qr8,NuclearBurrit0,"AP items have a problem. There is the non-fundamental problem of specific numbers balance, but that applies to every set of items and isn't what I want to talk about here.

What I want to discuss is the homogenization of AP items in league compared to other kinds of items.

There are 4 fundumentally different types of AP champions in league, however there are only 3 sets of AP mythics and 2 sets of AP legendaries, compared to AD champions which have 3 sets of mythics, 3 sets of legendries and 3 different categories with some flexing into tank under appropriate scenario's.

The 4 catagories are:

* Mages
* AP assassins
* AP bruisers/fighters
* Enchanters

Of these, enchanters are properly segregated into their own set of items, while the other 3 categories of champions all share legendries.

In particular, it is notoriously difficult to develop AP bruiser/fighter items because AP assassins can poach them. Why is this this a problem for AP bruisers but not AD bruisers? Because AD assassins are bound much harder to their secondary stats and have stronger item synergies with their intended items.

Basically, AP assassin items aren't synergistic enough, so they can flex into AP bruiser items without losing much.

To prove the point, lets ask the following question: Why does Kha'zix not buy Deaths Dance? 55 AD is certainly competitive compared to the other items he builds, the passives are hardly useless for a champion that wants to one shot someone and dip and who doesn't want some extra ability haste and armor?

Maybe it's because he already has so much escape and doesn't need it. Ok, so what about Samira then. Why doesn't she build deaths dance? She wants to go in, kill targets and then bounce between the Survivors. Shouldn't the healing passive and armor make a huge difference in making that successful?

Not really, because while a bit of defense is nice, these champions REALLY want lethality and crit respectively to the point where an item that doesn't give that is almost not even worth considering unless the passive is so insanely good that you don't even care about the stats (like with GA).

Some champions are more bound to their core stats than others, but the point is that they are bound to a stat other then AD in the first place.

With enchanters and bruisers this is relatively easy.

Enchanters need AH, mana regen and Heal power while Bruisers need AH and defensive stats. Both of them need some AP on top of this of course, but an item that gives a ton of AP and not much else won't interest them very much.

For the record, I'm not considering passives yet, Bruisers of course want things like max HP shred passives, ramping damage etc while Enchanters want active buffs and empower boosting passives. I'm just talking about the raw stats here.

But what about Mages and AP assassins?

Mages want mana, AH and AP while AP assassins want AP and AH. If we remove the AP for being too basic we are just left with a shit ton of AH, which is also the stat bruisers want. No wonder they can steal bruiser items, they all want the same stats so there's nothing to stop item theft.

However, there is a stat that has proven able to fix this problem in the past that I haven't mentioned yet: Magic pen.

Currently there is like, 3 items in the entire game that give flat magic pen, and of these 2 of them are mythics of which one is a mage item and the 3rd is sorc boots.

If we made a ton of flat magic pen items with AP assassin synergy and then rebalance AP assassin numbers around the existence of these items, then suddenly an item like demonic embrace is a much harder item to justify buying. Exactly like how deaths dance or really bruiser items in general are almost never a real consideration for AD assassins.

Then once we have a good ecosystem of AP assassin items that the class is hardbound to, we can develop proper AP bruiser items that don't give the magic pen AP assassins now need.

Once we do that, since AP bruisers and assassins now have their own dedicated items, mages can have mana spread out among most of their items again like they used to be since they don't have to share just like enchanters already do.

So we have another 3 AP mythics to account for this additional binding (possibly making only 1 new AP assassin mythic since rocketbelt and night harvester are perfectly fine assassin items), adding flat pen on AP assassin legendries, adding a few more of those legendries, add the AP bruiser items now that poaching them no longer works, re-specialize mage items and then just tweak the appropriate kit numbers for balance and call it a day.

Heck, we could even do things like adding mana to zhonya's so AP assassins like Akali can't build it as easily.

This was part of what I was expecting them to do in the first place with the S11 item rework, but they kinda just never did.

TLDR: Adding more flat magic pen fixes everything.",2021-05-01 03:07:22,143.0,n2102b

3d9qcdms,Geneticsquash,"AP champions can deal up to 65+% magic penetration in a game. If I have 100 Magic resist that is reduced by 60+% that leaves me lower than 40- magic resist. The biggest thing is that there´s a lot of magic damage items that deals damage over time.

There is no magic resist item that reduces magic damage. It´s just flat.

No boots that reduce magic damage overtime

No magic resist tier 1 item that gives grievous wound

Force of natures just gives you 40 flat magic resist, should reduce by 15-20% magic damage instead

Spirit Visage doesn´t work on most tanks

Abyssal mask - Worse than last season.

Maw of crap has been a bad item for years

All other MR items like Wits end or a quicksilver item  just gives flat magic resist and  focus on the passive/active.

There is not a single item that counters magic damage, they just gives flat Magic resist. How is that not addressed when there´s like 5 armor items countering ad champions.

Randuins Omen, Ninja Tabi, Frozen Heart, Thornmail, Hourglass. All of the reduces Attack Damage.

Magic Resist Items are so bad.

**Edit:**  Mistyped on 65% magic pen (If you don´t play mordekaiser lol) The exact rounded number is 55. And when I said Mages **CAN** deal up to 55% doesn´t mean they have to be good or bad, some champions doesn't  even go full magic pen in their final build. **I´m just saying Magic Resist items are really poorly designed across all roles.**

**Edit 2:**  Its kinda cool I got so many responses, even if some are more negative than others. OK People are talking about if mages are bad or good, but we are not only talking about this patch or whats meta in pro play or in solo quo. If we look at ap items in general. They are pretty diverse. I can go burst build, dealing damage over time build or ap bruiser build. Mages got item diversity, even if they are bad now, they are probably getting buffed in the future. We now are talking about **Magic Resist Item**. Which have less diversity than their armor counterpart. Ability power has very few counter option for **Bruisers, assassins or tanks for years.** Tanks are probably suffering most atm. We were promised item diversity in the Magic resist department, **Maybe thats the reason why mage items got nerfed, because there were never any good magic resist item.**",2021-04-30 15:01:36,778.0,n1oed4

Hey everyone,

I've created a Mundo Dodgeball for Sunday @ 1pm pacific time / 4pm eastern time on the NA SERVER. It is free and anyone can join. I am trying to get at least 32 players. The prizes are $25rp for 1st,  $15rp for 2nd, and $10rp for 3rd. The tournament will be casted by a twitch streamer, so it should make watching the games a lot of fun.

Here are the rules:

Best of 3 ||Semis: Best of 5 ||Finals: Best of 5

Single elimination (if you lose, the tournament is over for you)

Use already created Sorcery: The Calamity|| Flash & Ghost summoners

Start with boots, 1 control ward, 1 free ward, 2 pots. Start with ""Q""

Use picture to create ""line barrier"" in Baron pit.

You and opponent agree on start time.

Only use cleavers to damage opponent. NO AUTO ATTACKING

Crossing line or leaving Baron pit results in loss for that match (clearly over line. no ""nitpicking"")

First player to die takes the L.

Once match complete, end and create new match.

1yn0w2dg,xObiJuanKenobix,"I'm genuinely curious, not raging or flaming, but honestly just curious as to how fighting this champion is supposed to go. This isn't like a Morde situation where all of his skillshots have obvious indicators with obvious counters like standing in the minion wave for Q, she seems like more of a ""statcheck"" champion if that makes sense. Where its nearly impossible to dodge her actual abilities and its more of ""if you do more damage, you win"" atleast from my experience. Kinda like with Renekton except AP. Her Q is almost impossible to dodge with how fast it is, E gets on like a 5-6 second cooldown at level 1 so you can barely run away from the fight since she can just chase you down with that attack range, attack speed, and fast gap closer. She gets crazy bonus stats in W (like 20 armor early is like WOW levels of stats, thats Ninja tabis worth of armor) for free, and she gets the %max health magic dmg on everything.

So what do I even do when fighting her? I just fought her as Kled and it almost felt impossible to win. She feels like a AP Sett where if you get into any sort of sustained fight with her, you just lose by default. There's no real good early game MR items to go against her because Hexdrinker is terrible, the only one you can go is Merc treads. There's no like Bramble vest ninja tabi start you can do like when against melee ad champs. All MR items seem to be balanced around burst damage or CC instead of sustained AP damage, with the only exception seeming to be Force of Nature. But when she builds resistances, she also gains damage as well like with Zhonyas. But even building resistances against her doesn't really do anything because 1/2 of her damage is true damage from Q. So I get slowed by R, chased down with E, take 1/2 of my healthbar from one Q, and then take two more casts of R to do even more damage. 

Like I said, this isn't supposed to be a rant about Gwen being broken or something, I'm just at a complete lack of ideas of how to actually fight this champion in lane. Especially once she gets riftmaker, what do I do? She now is healing off of all that damage, she has great base stats with W up. If she goes Bramble Ninja Tabi with armor runes start against me, she has 120 armor against me and thats just with her level 1 armor base stat, that's a 55% damage reduction against me. If she's level 7, it's 139 armor with W up which is 58% damage reduction.  What can I build early to counter her damage? Merc treads? If Im kled at level 7 with Merc treads, I have 59 MR which is 37% damage reduction. So its 58% compared to 37%, and even with that 37% half of her damage is true damage.

Is there some secret tactic I'm missing? I'm expecting the old ""get good"" response from people which is true I want to get good, the problem is I literally don't know how. I'm at a complete lack of ideas as to what I'm supposed to do.",2021-05-01 04:33:18,41.0,n22ris

Someone says *Plat* is high elo, other says *Master* is high elo, and then there's people who think even *Master* is ""low elo"" and that *Challenger* is actually high elo. This is baffling, and so inconsistent among players. I can't understand how Diamond for example would be considered low elo when **only 1,5%** of ranked players are there.

This is why talking about ""mid elo"", or ""upper mid elo"" would be a lot more fair. But more so, I think this current system is just an ego trip for players to feel superior. ",2021-05-01 17:56:33,3.0,n2fb37

I just think it's time to realise that people here enjoy their human champs just fine. I agree that Riot hasn't been putting out menacing looking monster champs but I'd confidently say you're the vocal minority here. Just because you're only seeing lack of monster complaint posts doesn't mean there aren't people here who appreciate human champs more.

# 

# Void Battle axe  [ melee only Mythic item ]

* **5% Movement speed**
* **Mythic Passive:** Empowers each of your other Legendary items with 5 Armor, 5 Magic Rezist and 10 AP.

***So this is more tanky oriented AP Bruiser item. I think it would open new possible build path for AP Bruisers and it would give them some rezistances that they are lacking.***

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Celestial Rush

* **40 AP**

# Cursed Chestplate

* **50 AP**

&#x200B;

# Battle Sacrifice

* **70 AP**
* **30 Armor and Magic Rezist**
* **Unique** **Passive - LAST BREATH:** If your HP drops below 20% you can activate this item and get bursts of shield (300-1000 based of your level) and 50% movement speed at cost of 10% of your HP. (90 seconds cooldown).

This does exactly what it's name says. You sacrifice some chunk of your HP to get big shield and movement speed ,which would allowed you to reposition and barely survive.

**NOTE: If you have 10% (or lower) of HP this item will kill you.**

&#x200B;

# Adaptive Hex-Knife

* **50 AP**
* **25 AD**
* **300 HP**
* **Unique Passive - ADAPT** After you activate this item, your abilites and auto attacks will deal 50% Physical damage and 50% Magical damage for 2.5 seconds (20 seconds cooldown).

This is some my experiment. I think this item could be pretty good if your team decided to go full AP teamcomp and enemy stacked MR against you.

scu39mb,skull11244,"Warning: wall of text with no TLDR

&#x200B;

In this post, I'm going to look at two things in as complete a way as I can. These things will be autofill and dodging, which go hand in hand. There isn't any complaining, and no ranting. Just walls of text. At the end I will give some suggestions for how you can help improve both of these things for the entire community

Note that most of what I talk about will not be applicable to the highest tiers of League: Master and above. Riot has already (for better or worse) removed duo queueing from there, so I will put that as the cut-off point. These tiers also represent such a small fraction of the playerbase (under 0.5%) that I feel like excluding them will not impact very many people who do end up reading this.

&#x200B;

**Autofill**

Just to clear up exactly what autofill is, just in case. Autofill is when you put 2 roles, and get a third (often jungle). It is not when you get your secondary role. While this sucks, being able to play at the minimum a second lane should be an important skill.

As an ex support main who moved to jungle about 2 years ago, I have very little experience with autofill. It still happens to me on occasion, but most of this will be based on the experiences of others, from this Reddit, to friends I play with every week, to people I play with once and never see again.

Autofill complainers seem to be the very vocal minority. Every day there is a new post on this Reddit with someone complaining about autofill reducing the quality of the games they play. And this **IS** true. Most of the time someone in the game is autofilled, they are put in a role that they are less comfortable in then their main one. Often this is dramatically less so (mid to jungle). However even if you are a mid onetrick yasuo and you get autofilled to top, and you still lock in yasuo, you are at a disadvantage compared to midlane. The size and shape of the lane is different from what you are used to, and you might not know the matchup at all. There shouldn't be an argument that autofill hurts the quality of games where is comes up.

Now most people seem to have accepted that it is a necessary evil. However what happens if it is removed? For a look at this, let's go to the days of teambuilder. While I don't have the exact stats on wait times, and barely remember anything from those ""good old days"", I do remember the wait time could be really bad. When I played as support, I rarely waited. But I do remember waiting 15 minutes because I really wanted to get top lane. Teambuilder had some massive flaws (if you weren't playing the meta well GL to you good sir), but it was a mode without autofill. You always got to play the role that you wanted to. You just had to wait for it.

So what happens if we remove autofill from draft pick. While we do not know what percent of the player base plays each role, from everything I have seen, jungle is the least popular role and mid is the most popular role. I'm going to throw an example in here, and while it isn't anywhere near what reality is, it will show a glimmer of what might happen in a world without autofill.

For this example, we have only 100 players at a certain skill level. 22 top, 20 adc, 18 support, 24 mid and 16 jungle. If all these players queue at the exact same time, then 8 games start. Until either a game finishes or more people queue as jungle, then 20 players will sit in queue, including 2 support players who are playing a less popular role. There is nothing that they can do to speed up their queue times, as swapping to jungle will just mean no supports are available anymore.  Anyways, once the first game finishes, if all 10 players requeue, then the 2 mid laners will go to the back of the queue, meaning they are position 9 and 10. Their wait time will be crazy long. Once the next game finishes then those new midlaners will be at the back, and have a long wait. So on and so forth.

While this is a VERY simple example, it does show two problems that can occur. First, the popular positions have noticeably more players. In the example, the roles weren't that far spread out, but mid had 50% more player then jungle. Extreme, yes, but the point is still there. Second, the poor support players. They are already playing a less popular role, they moved out of their precious mid lane, but their queue time is still partially gated by a less popular role. Whatever the least popular role is, it gates EVERYONE else.

Now there is a partial solution to having no autofill. It won't help the extreme ends of the ladder (iron and master+), but it would help some people get into faster games with no autofill. Allow players of wider skill levels to play together. But would this really improve the quality of games?

Another example. I recently played a game against a onetrick gold 3 Yi. (I am plat 4) Despite my team having very little reliable hard cc, and him having a Nocturne mid (whose ult could split us up even for a second), we won due to getting a 27 minute fire soul. He just didn't have the map knowledge to realize when drag was going. This is just one example, and might not be the best, but still.

Having players whose skill level on the same team can be just as bad. No one likes to be carried by your Darius who is mid plat when you are in your promos to gold. (It's a good strat, just feelsbadman) And in the end, this wouldn't even help reduce queue times at the end of ladder. It might even make it worse at the low end, where there are more mid laners.

&#x200B;

Long long story short(er) for autofill, it is likely here to stay. Riot is trying to make jungle more accessible to more players, but that's a small step, and there will almost certainly be a least popular role and a mid lane. It feel incredibly bad when it happens to you in your promos, and watching a 2 million mastery udyr wipe your autofilled nunu sucks. Just keep in mind that it is not just happening to you, that everyone in a role autofills about the same amount.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**DODGING**

This one is going to be alot more fun to talk about. In my opinion, dodging is something that shouldn't be a thing, but with how the game has developed, it is **mandatory** to be able to do it properly. While the recent patch supposedly increased the penalties (haven't dodged myself since then), this is not the solution. I will talk about ways to reduce dodging later. For now, lets look at the most common reasons to dodge.

1. You're a onetrick who got banned/picked out
2. Someone on your team is trolling
3. Team comp. Playing versus a Yi/Kat with no cc, rammus versus 4 adcs, etc...
4. The enemy has a champion you hate. Basically the ""I want a second+ ban so this is how I get it""
5. You have someone playing a ""non meta"" champion. Twitch jungle, Zed top
6. You have someone either tilted (5 game losing streak, basically ran it down last 2) or with a 37% win rate 0.9 kda

Let's look at each of these in turn. For the first one. Sidetrack starting. As a onetrick myself I can understand this one. And while you might hate that I dodge, if I'm not on Rek'sai, I'm worse the autofilled. (Yes I need 2 more champions, thanks) The person dodging is likely doing you a favor here. Now is onetricking good, that's another complete post, and this one is long enough already. Now for my onetrick, in my climb from silver to plat, I had to dodge for this reason exactly once. If I was a onetrick Hecarim, lets say things would be different. It is a matter of how popular your onetrick is. Sidetrack over. This one is probably the best reason to dodge. While you can argue that you don't deserve you rank if you can only get it on one champion, still. Yes, WE should learn to play more champions, but until we get our head out of our asses and suck it up, we will dodge.

Second, you got a troll. Either their champion was banned and they don't want to dodge themselves or this is how they stay happy, this happens. If you do decided to dodge them, please, please, PLEASE, just do it. Don't wait till the last second hoping someone else will bite the bullet. You are wasting everyone's time as well as your own. The best thing you can do however, is just play the game out.  Lose. Cry. Watch a video to untilt. The most important think you can do, however, is go to [this link](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and fill out a manual report. Include chat logs, a replay, and if their match history shows that they are doing it non stop, put that in as well. Then keep playing. Help keep our rift clean. Don't feed the trolls. The loss sucks, but it doesn't change your skill as a player. If you are better then your current rank, you will keep climbing, trolls be damned.

Third, drafting is part of the game. If you got outskilled in the game, there isn't a reset button. Same should be true with drafting. Get better at it. If you are low ranked and often see these onesided drafts, then either ban the champion who abuses it the best (Yi) or play them/their counter. If you aren't a onetrick/adc main, see what your team is hovering and what is missing. Fill in the gap, even if you don't want to. Don't dodge it.

Fourth. This one is controversial. Like very. I will talk about this one at the end with advise on how to improve dodging for everyone. Sorry

Fifth, ask them to carry you. Ten to one they know what they are doing. If it is something EXTREME (yummi anywhere but support) ask them if they know what they are doing. Often, they fit into the second point  of trolls. While you can't technically report them, if they are running it down, go ahead.

Sixth, stop looking at your teammates pre-game. Use blitz/whatever to look at runes if that's what you do, and maybe who is duo'd. Not at your teammates win %. If their win rate is completely atrocious, then they might fall under point 2. It applies. (Sidenote. Do use your blitz/whatever after the game to see where you can improve. Spoiler, it's warding)

While there are other things that might make you dodge, hopefully I covered most of them here.

&#x200B;

Ok on to the ending. If everyone stopped abusing it, then the penalties for it wouldn't have to go up. If Riot were to have a better system in place to catch trolls in select, then dodging would go down. Until then (GL) it is going to be here. There will not be a way around dodging. Everyone reporting someone is just abusable. And that's the best idea I've seen and have for a replacement. The community needs to self monitor, with no prodding from Riot. In order to reduce dodging, everyone need to come together and stop trying to make others dodge so they don't have to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, now on to what you can do to help with both of these problems. For autofill.

1. I brushed up on this earlier, but if you can only play one role, learn a second. Primary, secondary. Done.
2. Don't flame your jungler. Trust me, he's trying. If he quits, you will have to take his place next game. Flame your mid laner. He deserves it more.
3. Learn jungle. Feel our pain, but never get autofilled again. Plus someone else will be spared.
4. If you do get autofilled to a role you can't play, dodge immediately.

And that brings me to dodging.

1. When you do decide to dodge, do it immediately. Waiting wastes your time and everyone else's. Suck it up.
2. Don't troll. I shouldn't have to say this.
3. If you find that your dodge timer is too high, and you need to either hope someone else dodges or troll to make someone else dodge, then reevaluate why you are dodging. You can't win them all, stop trying.
4. If you do have a lost of champions you dodge everytime, follow these steps.

* Limit the number that you dodge: 4 is on the high end
* Ban the most popular one. Don't try to add another name to the list with the excuse of ""well I never dodge him, I ban him ""
* Understand why you are dodging each. Are the a counter to your onetrick? Do you hate Yi? Are they (in your opinion) too strong? Do you hate laning top versus vayne/hemier? Do you hate lux's laugh spam?
* Reevaluate the list often. Did someone just get nerfed and isn't strong enough anymore? Can you mute lux laugh spam? (no really, can you?)

The game was so unwinnable as the score was 46 to 27 (I'm in the 27) but the game is won by taking down the nexus. We did just that as a team. I was so surprised that none of us were flaming each other. We just kinda accepted the fact that we're bad, and encourage each other. Somehow we made it. This definitely did not feel like the League of Legends that I'm playing but you get this kind of game in a while. Good mentality = ez win.

Heck the game was so crazy that I had to tell myself to make this video. I made it in two hours so the quality is sorta bad, sorry about that. Also, imagine playing league, winning these kinds of games without getting a noise complaint at midnight, which explain why I'm screaming as if I don't wanna wake up my mom while I play league of legends lmao.

4ffvev5v,Tannir48,"With about 4 million pts on the champion, I love playing Thresh as much as anyone but I think it's clear that right now, ghosty boi is stronger than he should be. He is the best support in almost every elo in every patch earning an [S+ ranking](https://u.gg/lol/champions/thresh/build) from [u.gg](https://u.gg/) with a pickrate and banrate higher than every support except Morgana.

Thresh's current dominance and apparent immunity to the last two nerfs Riot gave him makes me think that, sooner or later, he will be nerfed again. I've been thinking about ways to change Thresh to make him less dominant and this is what I came up with..

My suggested Thresh nerf: **reduce his base armor by 6.**

What does this mean in terms of numbers?

With **22 armor** Thresh would have 1 - 100/122 = 1- 0.81967 or approximately 18% physical damage reduction

What Thresh has right now: 1 - 100/128 = 1 - 0.78125 or approximately 22% physical damage reduction

This means Thresh would lose 4% damage reduction level 1 vs physical damage. Suppose a Caitlyn with 75 AD autos Thresh at lvl 1. Right now, excluding any defensive runes or collected souls, Thresh takes 58.5 or 59 damage (numbers are always rounded up if decimal is .5 or greater). With this change, Thresh takes 61.5 or 62 damage. That's 3 additional damage taken per every Caitlyn auto.

That may not sound like much but it quickly adds up over repeated autos as well as minion aggro and other factors. This is especially true with runes like hail of blades which can apply autoattacks very quickly.

Also consider effective health. Effective health, per lolwiki, is how much health a champion has accounting for their resistances against various types of damage. Generally, at lvl 1 Thresh will have 591 health with his support item and 28 base armor.

This translates into 756.48 or 756 effective health vs physical damage. With runes Thresh can max out his armor at 40 for 827 effective health in this regard. With the suggested nerf these numbers change to 721 and 792 effective health respectively. So this would nerf Thresh's effective health against physical damage by approximately 35 at lvl 1.

**Why this change?** Because Thresh used to have the lowest base armor in the entire game before patch 7.22, when his base armor went from the worst to somewhere in the middle. When Thresh had terrible base armor, his winrates were consistently lower. Per [leagueofgraphs,](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/thresh) Thresh winrate barely broke 50% at any point between seasons 5, 6, and 7. However after runes reforged (right around patch 7.22), the combination of the armor buff and Thresh's excellent synergy with aftershock, his winrate rarely drops *below* 50%. This is a net increase of 1-2% of his winrate on average from season 8 until now.

Note that even when Thresh had 16 base armor he was still a good, playable pick if not the very best or the most dominant. And hitting his base armor by 6 doesn't even make him the squishiest support as he was before season 8. In fact, **before patch 7.22 even Janna had more armor than Thresh. 19 vs 16 level 1.** Here, Thresh would still outclass Seraphine, 22 armor vs 19.

Thresh is a champion who loves to play aggressively and go in with his powerful earlygame combo and high damage. The trade off for this used to be how squishy he was. And while Thresh is still squishy, I do not think he is as squishy as he should be, especially since it's entirely possible to rush double adaptive and bonk enemies with 70 damage autos at level 1 with 34 armor. The high reward doesn't carry a high enough risk. With this change Thresh players will be forced to take double defensive runes to avoid being blown up, hitting Thresh's damage potential while also nerfing his tankiness.

This will also kill the guardian build as Thresh, lacking more resistances, won't be able to afford avoiding aftershock. I think this is good because, first, the guardian build has one of the [highest winrates](https://u.gg/lol/champions/thresh/build?rank=diamond_2_plus) of all Thresh builds because of its peel and utility with W which is partially why he is performing so well. But it is also because Thresh was never meant to play as a shieldbot/enchanter he was meant to be played as an aggressive playmaker. The fact this build works as well as it does is a problem with how difficult is to punish Thresh for skirting on tankiness in favor of other stats (damage or shielding).

With this in mind I also think his E nerf should be reverted because if Thresh is going to be squishier it's fair that he has a key cooldown up more often so he can cast it more than once before dying.

The point of this nerf isn't to kill Thresh but to drop his wr, banrate, and pickrate so not only is it easier to pick up and play Thresh but he also isn't completely dominant in the current meta. I think this is a good way to achieve those aims while avoiding additional cooldown nerfs which limit playmaking opportunities for a champion whose entire identity revolves around a highlight reel.",2021-04-30 15:10:19,124.0,n1oigj
83mggia7,Metapocalypse1," Hello everyone its metapocalypse again and im back with the 5 things series, a series of articles I write and will maybe one day turn into a video series. In this edition we are discussing the top 5 reasons to main mid lane this season. Shout out to twitter for giving me advice on why you would even want to main this role, they had some great answers and really helped me out with this one.  

&#x200B;

Reason 1 – Champion style diversity. Mid lane right now is flooded with in the meta champions that cover a lot of different styles. Do you like AD assassins, go mid, AP assassins, go mid, mages, mid support style champs, Mid, tanks, mid, marksman, Mid, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice and a partridge in a pear tree can all be taken mid lane, and you will still be choosing a high tier champion. So, before riot comes to their senses and balances the game, take advantage of the fact that there seems to be no limit on the number of different champions viable In the mid lane.  

&#x200B;

Reason 2 – 1v1 potential. In the mid lane, its just you vs your opponent. No relying on lane partners like the bot lane, no relying on good laners like in the jungle. While it is true that the occasional Jungler will appear to try and disrupt this status quo, for the most part, and certainly for the early levels at least. Then lane relies on you, and you alone. So, if there was ever a time to step up and prove your worth, now is it. 

&#x200B;

Reason 3 – Out play Mechanics – Mid lane has some of the highest mechanically challenging champions on the rift. Almost all the assassins need a high level of mechanical skill, and while some are easier to master than others, everyone can see the difference between a good assassin, and a great one. Even some of the non-assassin champions like Azir and twisted fate need excellent positioning and mechanical prowess to unlock their full potential.

&#x200B;

Reason 4 – Roaming. Even if your lane is not going exactly as you planned, or if your lane is going perfectly and you have dominated your lane opponent. Your roam potential as a mid laner should never be underestimated. If you spot the enemy jungler taking his blue buff, go invade and take it for yourself. If you spot that bot lane is a little over extended, free double kill. Only the mid laner has quick access to every part of the map and should always use it to their advantage. 

&#x200B;

Reason 5 – Tons of Damage, It doesn’t seem to matter what kind of champion you play, the amount of damage you bring to the game is off the charts, Even if you are 1 or 2 kills behind it just does not seem to matter. You have one of the most important roles in the game and the carry potential to take over any team fight. The wide array of items that have been provided this season just add to the amount of damage output most mid laners have. 

&#x200B;

So, what do you think? are you convinced to play mid lane yet? Are you already a mid laner and have better reasons than this for choosing the role? Let me know in the comments below and we can have a discussion. Next article will either be reasons to main top lane, or 5 champions with the coolest lore. If you have any opinions on those topics as well, let me know in the comment section and your idea might appear in the next article/video.",2021-05-01 17:24:34,0.0,n2ex87

2byziv3,JauneOG,"Hi! I'm looking to start playing League since all my friends have been playing for years. I've never been really interested before but suddenly I feel I am. It seems extremely overwhelming to begin playing though and don't really know where to start. I would let my friends teach me but I have tried that before and I just don't find it fun basically just doing exactly what they say, it's not fun.

So before I start I wanted to only play champions that really interest me, since in the past I only played ones that I was told to. The List I created was as follows (not in any particular order): Zed, Aatrox, Kayn, Jhin, Karthus, Pantheon, Varus, Mordekaiser, Jarvan, Volibear.

Now personally I have watched gameplay on these champions and my personal like endgame of where I'd want to be is a Zed main. I would just jump in and try to learn league and Zed at the same time but I've heard Zed is a high skill character and I'll only get frustrated and quit if I start there.

hgob5,CoolKnightST,"Considering negative behavior is such a problem in league and there is little to no punishment (especially against public figures). Can't we find different ways to punish these kinds of players?

Some examples:

&#x200B;

**High elo program**

* Offer popular streamers, high mmr players and pro's the option to enter a program. This program gives them a paid contact with RIOT where they can send reports to. This way any way of misconduct will be punished instantly.
   * As a side-effect of this benefit, these players have to follow the code of conduct to the letter. If they break the agreement they get fined. Currently pro players can already be fined for unsportmanship behavior and it has been proven this way of punished works for public figures. 

As a sidenote: I'm aware there already exist a streamer program that gives them benefits. This program used to have an unofficial contact for these kind of things and it actually backfired a few years ago where some streamers where abusing it. If a fine-system is set in place with an official contact and a legal framework. This sort of scandals would no longer lead to such a things. I'm sure streamers will put in more effort on the behaviour if they actually have some of these privileges.

**Locked mode**

This form of punishment disables them for using any type of RP customized option (skins, chroma, icon) or features (profile, match history, collections) in the client. They can only press play.

**Advertising mode**

This form of punishment is similar to locked mode. But now advertisements will be in the client. Players will have to watch an short advertisement between games. 

A second feature of this mode is that streamers will have one of there skins activated for the champion they are going to play that they already own. This selection is based on an algoritme which skin needs more advertisement. Basicly RIOT can decide with what skin they should play.

This type of punishment will mostly affect streamers that break the rules.",2021-05-01 19:32:43,0.0,n2gkt0

If you lose but play well you lose less ***MMR***, if you win but play bad you gain less ***MMR***.  
Literally every player in the lobby decides the LP outcome.)  
(Note: I am aware ***Win-Trading*** exists, and that will be snuffed out the moment they are in a   
fair lobby. Survival of the fittest and the ***MMR*** system will make them lose more than   
the rest of their because of their bad gameplay, I.E. They will be shoved down way   
faster than their teammates unless they can learn to play better.)  
C. All playlist will have a separate ***MMR***.  
Note: All players will find a game within a certain threshold of their ***MMR***.  
D. All players in a playlist will be grouped with other players within a certain range their ***MMR***  
***Blind Pick***, ***Draft Pick***, ***Ranked Solo/Duo***, and ***Ranked Flex*** each will have separate ***MMR***.  
Note: You cannot farm ***MMR*** in one playlist, then have it carry over to another playlist  
***ChampionGrade***: [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Champion\_Mastery](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Champion_Mastery)  
The better you did in that part of the match.
2. Remove the ***League Point (LP)*** System: Goal - Straightforward, no exploitable mechanics.  
A. No more ***LP.***  
B. ***MMR*** will be directly tied to your Rank.  
(Iron VI 0-100 ***MMR)*** or (Gold I 1501-1600 ***MMR)*** or (Master II 2601-2700 ***MMR*** etc.)  
Note: There is absolutely no need for ***LP***, when you can simply use ***MMR*** (LP is completely unnecessary, simply use their ***MMR*** and call it a day: Even if someone could figure out their ***MMR*** they could not farm it because making a new account would not make your earn ***MMR*** faster, all they would do is start from square one and the best they can hope for is they lose less often as they climb back up the exact same place they were before).  
C. Remove ***Provisional Matches***.  
Note: You make the ***Division*** or you do not.  
D. Remove ***Grace Period***.  
Note: Another player will not suffer because you want a second chance in that ***Division***.  
E. Make ***Autofill*** an option you can turn on or off.  
Note: ***Autofill*** will be your fault.
3. Lock Ranks behind ***Honor Level*** (After a good ***Honor*** system ***Report*** system is created).  
A. ***Honor Level*** 1 = Iron  
B. ***Honor Level*** 2 = Bronze - Gold  
C. ***Honor Level*** 3 = Platinum - Diamond  
D. ***Honor Level*** 4 = Master - Grandmaster  
E. ***Honor Level*** 5 = Challenger  
Note: Only good sportsman deserve higher ranks after a better ***Honor*** and ***Report*** system are made, toxic people do not deserve higher ranks because it will trickle down like it has been for years (Think of ***MMR*** being local for each playlist, and ***Honor*** being Global for all playlists). ***Honor Level*** is supposed to be a trust system because of how much time it takes to earn an ***Honor Level***, older accounts have more trust to hold higher ranks. Toxic players will not be allowed to hold high Ranks.
4. Hit Ranked ***MMR*** for bad sportsmanship.  
A. If you ***Dodge*** a Ranked Game, then it counts as an automatic loss for you.  
B. If you ***Dodge*** a Ranked Game multiple times in a row, an additional loss for each ***Dodge***.  
(***Dodge*** once = 1 loss), (***Dodge*** twice = 1+1 losses), (***Dodge*** three times = 1+2 losses)  
C. If you ***Dodge*** a Ranked Game more than three times in a row, temporary ban from the playlist.  
(***Dodge*** fourth = 1 week ban), (***Dodge*** Fifth = 2 Week ban), etc.  
D. If you go ***AFK*** in a Ranked Game, you will be temporarily banned from that playlist.  
(***AFK*** once = 1 Week Ban), (***AFK*** Twice = 2 Week Ban), etc. Go play Unranked and get better.  
E. You get only 1 free ***Dodge*** per week, because life happens: You should plan better.  
Note: If you stop the game from being played you will be punished on the spot, it forces you to be held accountable and change your behavior for the better or every account you make will suffer the same result (If your so good, then you do not need to dodge).
5. ***Report*** System - Create a new Tribunal  
A. A ***Report*** will be sent against a player for Team Chat,  
if three or more players on the same team send a ***Report*** for the same player,  
then the ***Report*** will be processed and an outcome determined (punish or no).  
B. A ***Report*** will be sent against a player for All Chat,  
if three or more players on the enemy team send a ***Report*** for the same player,  
then the ***Report*** will be processed and an outcome determined (punish or no).  
C. Let the team decide if their ally is toxic, then let the system give a verdict.  
Let the enemy decide if their ally is toxic, then let the system give a verdict.  
D. If you were successfully reported, you lose ***MMR***: Yes that can affect your rank depending on  
your ***MMR*** (For that Playlist) and ***Honor Levels)*** (For all Playlist).  
E. Enable voice chat all the time like Valorant, but make sure you cannot voice chat with the  
enemy team like Valorant: Valorant is just like League except First Person, this means  
teamwork is essential and it is a lot better to make the non-LCS closer to LCS for the sake of  
balancing patches and gameplay.  
Note: Let the players decided if something should go through the Reporting process and be judged by a non-bias process, this makes the ***Player*** the first and last defense like the ***Code of Conduct*** states.  


Summary:  


1. ***Match Making Rating (MMR)***: A simple system to determine who is better.  

2. ***League Point (LP)***: Remove it from the game.  

3. ***Honor Level***: Only good sportsman should be allowed to rank up.  

4. ***Dodge***: Punish people who prevent the game from being played, immediately and directly.  

5. ***Report***: Players decide what is worth processing through the system.  


Notes:  


1. ***Match Making Rating (MMR)***: Will be staying, although the current system can be used instead of my proposed system.  

2.  ***League Point (LP)***: Needs to be removed from the game, unless ***LP*** will directly correlate with ***MMR.***  

3. ***Honor Level***: Will be staying because toxic players do not deserve high ranks.  

4. Hitting ***MMR***: Yes you will lose ***MMR*** and be penalized for dodging, because you stop the game from being played and you apparently do not want to play the game.  

5. ***Report***: The only purpose of this change to the report system is to reduce the amount of stupid reports that somehow go through, until a better ***Report*** system is made.  


Common Questions:   


1. [kontra5](https://www.reddit.com/user/kontra5/): So you want challenger skilled player who has honor 2 only to be able to play in bronze-gold because of honor level. And then have players complain about smurfs?  
\_  
Answer: Yes, I want a Bronze II player to fight a Challenger VI player, because their ***MMR*** is almost the same - This is because that Bronze II player is probably a Grandmaster+ and deserves to fight people of their same skill level.  

2. [kontra5](https://www.reddit.com/user/kontra5/): Who will they get matched to then? If challenger MMR would get matched with other challengers then what's the point?  
\_  
Answer: If an ***MMR*** exceeds their current Rank, then that ***MMR*** will be placed in what I call   
***Smurf Queue***. Every player in ***Smurf Queue*** will be forced to fight other players in ***Smurf Queue***, until they run out of players to fight and have to Rank up their ***Honor Level***. This will literally  end up with the smurf ending back up to where they originally were, only this time it may take more time considering how slow it can be honor up.  

3. So you want a Challenger I ***MMR*** to be Iron VI Rank, because they do not have a high enough Honor level?  
\-  
Answer: Yes, I want a Challenger I ***MMR*** to be Iron VI, because they must be toxic and deserve to stay in Iron Rank while still being able to compete against other Orin players who have a Challenger I ***MMR***. This is my ***Smurf Queue*** and you will be stuck in your Rank until you can honor your level back up, and will be forced to fight other people in your rank until you can Rank your ***Honor Level*** back up. If you run out of people in your Rank because your ***MMR*** is too good for even the other people in  ***Smurf Queue*** then you simply will not find a game, so go back to  ***Draft Pick*** and learn to be more honorable. If your ***MMR*** is greater than your current rank then you will automatically be put into what I call ***Smurf Queue***, because apparently you are too good for your own Rank and need to play with other people who are in your rank but are apparently too good for it to: It would be a shame if you ran out of people and had to go back ***Draft***, but considering how many smurfs there are in League I would not be surprised if you did not run out of people.",2021-05-01 19:21:30,0.0,n2gey9

I honestly feel like ADCs are the only ones who don't blow other things up because they practically don't get to exist. It also feels like there's way too much CC in the game with no CC of diminishing returns. You get CCe'd by the slightest amount, whether it's hard CC or a slow and you're guaranteed to die.

shsau,Nicolaskh,"It's unbelievable that after 11 seasons Riot didn't tried to make a game mode in League where people can actually learn the game

This new mode in TFT it's literally one of the best things they could do in order to help people learn the best basic things in the game, without making it complicated with all the strategies existent.

**I mean, what is one of the most needed thing to learn in league? The first 10 minutes of the game.**

Nowadays, how the people actually practice laning? Just playing rankeds, normals with a lot of other stuffs that influences your results, that can be a 15 minute game or 60 minute. And all of us knows (or at least should) that we have a lot more to worry in lane than just killing the other guy

And playing 1v1 with friends is just not a reality for a lot of people that either don't have friends that plays the game or have a big elo gap.

Just imagine how fast people could actually improve if they just practices 1v1s all day long, with 10-12 minute limit in each match.

**How Riot could do a game-mode for people improve their first 10 minutes that works?**

First of all, the objective should not be winning the game (it ends in the 10 minute mark).

Literally each people chose their lanes, play draft mode with or without bans and plays the lane for 10 minutes without having to worry about ganking, being ganked and all this stuff.

Your objective would be just outlane your opponent, winning in farm, killing them or whatever.

My guess is that people would become a lot better with their main champs (since it's easier and takes less time to practice) and in laning itself.

Yes, of course it could be harmful in terms of going to a ranked after 1 week training in the hyperbolic laning chamber and just not pay attention to the minimap (*Let's be honest, no one until diamond-masters even checks the minimap anyway*).

But people would improve a lot in their mechanics, and league in general would become a lot more skillful.

**1v1, 2v2, 4v4 or 5v5?**

That's probably the most hard question to answer.

I mean, in this game-mode you get exactly the lane that you want.

So, the ideal would be a 5v5 with you only being able to go to the role you chosed. (If you are the jungler you can't gank, but can walk in all yours and their jungle). But I think Riot can't do it with their ~~shit pasta~~ code.

So the other options would be 4v4 without a jungler in the game, and without the possibility to go to other lanes.

Or a queue with just 1v1 for top and mid, and a 2v2 for bot lane.

I mean, I get that this is difficulty to make it work, but would be REALLY good if they could do it in a way.

**How to balance it?**

It's simple, Riot would use the same MMR that you have in ranked, just in a separated game mode. In this way you always gets placed againt someone in the same level that you face in ranked.

The good thing about it is that since people only interact with their enemies in lane (or jungle), the elo of your ""team"" doesn't matter. All Riot should do is to balance in each role. *Considering if the game is 5v5.*

If it's a 1v1 or 2v2 in bottom, just place people against similar elos and it works perfectly.

**What is the benefits for a jungler?**

~~None, if you're in my team you're always useless anyway.~~

There is a gap between what you could get with this mode in lane and in the jungle, and obviously the junglers gets behind. Buuut you could work on your invades, different strategies, etc. Also, since you don't get leash, you could get better at kiting the camps and do the jungle in a efficient way.

But I reckon this game mode it's not as good for junglers as it is for laners. But I mean, the practice tool is better for get better in the jungle anyway.

**What if I face a troll as my lane opponent and he just afks?**

I mean, people should really be frustrated to get into a game mode for work in their laning skills and just quit in a game where you don't ""win or lose"", you just kills your opponent the most possible in 10 minutes.

Also, in the weird case you get to face troll in a 10 minute game it's not as bad as having a troll in your team and having to play sometimes until 30 minutes with a person that just don't care.

**TL;DR**

Riot should create a game mode for league that you only plays the lane phase, and objective is to just outlane your opponent and get better at laning.",2021-05-01 11:34:24,0.0,n2acr0

Any clubs or groups creating gatherings to watch live games together, as well as companies or lan centers that host tournaments and events should keep in mind that a big part of the enjoyment of any live sporting event is actually outside of the game itself.

I'm not looking for a free games, but instead for a chamipns that might work better in soloQ.

I want a champion that can bully assassins early levels (as Syndra and Orianna) but as well, can work more independently and more forgiving.

I just managed to hit top 100 challenger (734ish)lp with playing almost exclusively toplane (primary) and midlane (secondary) Zilean. It's absolutely crazy to me.

[https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=TheDisconnect](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=TheDisconnect)

I've played this game for about 8 years now and I have ALWAYS been told, ""no way dude, top Zilean is just a stupid pick which only works in low elo"". ""Pros would never play it so it's useless"". ""No way you could compete vs challengers"". And so on.

The classic every time I climb a rank, ""yeah this isn't gonna work in plat though"" then I get to plat and get told ""it won't work in diamond though"".

I am a person who has historically struggled a lot with self esteem within league of legends and the constant doubt from the players I played with or talked about always made me second guess myself. I just wanna post this showing that me, a complete idiot who plays a stupid champion in a stupid lane for fun managed to get top 100 on EUW. And if you wanna play toplane Nami or midlane Ivern but all your friends keep putting you down saying it's a troll pick and it would never work in a real game while they are inting their ass off on Udyr, I wanna let you know it can work! Just be a beast at the game and enjoy your crazy off meta pick.

I absolutely love weird picks and I wanna see more, but people think the meta is just set in stone now, and only in s3/4/5 could you do fun stuff. Just because you don't see it in high elo/pro play doesn't mean you cannot make it work. I'm still doing fun stuff and it's making me laugh and enjoy the game as much as possible :D

y8cqnu5,SexCrazedEve,"The main problem for low elo junglers is not understanding how to path correctly.  Myself included, until recently, had no idea what paths to take to make my jungle clear as efficient as possible while giving myself the most options available to me.  I used to hover around a 66% WR in ranked, which isn't crazy but I'm not a god.  However, with the changes this season, I've found myself at around a 20ish+ percent winrate.  Sounds terrible, yeah?  I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong, and finally, FUCKING FINALLY I found out what it was.  I looked up pathing videos and immediately could tell the difference in my performance.  Now, to the topic, the concern with catchup EXP is it reduces actual good junglers ability to consistently when matchups that they SHOULD win based off of their in game performance.  If you're looking to make it more accessible while letting the skill differential between players actually matter, you're shit out of luck.  Jungling isn't something that's entirely easy to understand.  For most players, myself included, we have to learn from better players if we're not able to determine what our own mistakes are.  The gold changes are irrelevant.  They make first backs stronger but you generate less gold for yourself over the course of the game.  Smite and omnivamp changes are also irrelevant and are merely placebos.  Sorry if this came off as a little rant-centric, but it's best to get it out in the open now before high elo suffers for low elo ineptitude.

Edit:  I suppose mentioning the smite damage changes, even if it has little relevance to the topic, is warranted.  There are pros and cons.  Pros probably outweighing the cons as they introduce an ACTUAL COMEBACK MECHANIC IN LEAGUE OF LEGENDS.  Only took them 11 seasons, but they did it.  Cons:  Mostly just what a player conceives as fair.  Is it fair for a team that's so behind to be able to comeback by being able to more easily steal an objective?

9z4xwkrj,Yamikoneko,"So, let's say a champ is a problem, right? Let's say, for sake of example, it's Trist. Now, she's been an issue before (many times actually), and the reasons for that might differ, but to me it seems like it's her absurd all in on top of high base damage on top of good scaling. She doesn't really have a weak point in the game, and not many champs can out duel her in a straight up fight (barring long range poke outs).

Now, she's an issue. So, in my mind, we'd, you know, address what makes her a problem. Namely, her safety and lack of a weak period in the game. So I'd drastically nerf her early game, and undo the ""W resets on max stack bomb"" change that sent her over the top. Great. Now she needs to scale a bit, and she can't just jump around like a bunny on some crazy drugs. She has some sort of weakness, and needs to play well to really use her resets.

Problem solved, right?

Now, looking at how Riot does things... I just don't get it. Trist has been a recurring problem for a while in this scenario, right? And she's popped into meta again in our pretend world here. Now that she's in every game, being banned a lot, and has clearly got too much going on for her... they just ignore her for several patches, and then finally ""nerf"" her by adding 2 seconds to her Q CD, or lowering her W base damage by 10, or increasing the mana cost on her ult by 20, or something.

How do any of those changes address what makes her a problem?

5z55evnz,HalexUwU,"Seeing as jungle is getting lots of changes to help the role overall, I think it might be time to start shifting our focus towards support, and how it (as either the least popular, or second least popular) is inaccessible to most players who don't specifically play support.

&#x200B;

While support is a VERY strong role and has a lot of impact in the right hands, it tends to have a very small playerbase, similarly to jungle. If jungles situation improves it's likely that support will become the next ""problem role"".

&#x200B;

Generally someone who can play mid has a grasp on how to play bot or top, and vise verse. You CS, you trade, ETC. The thing about support is that the role as a whole is different from everything else, and not just things like warding or CS'ing. The simple job of a support is completely different from other roles, even in champions. Basically no character outside of the support role can be compared to enchanters, tanks can barely be compared to wardens, ETC. Playing support for people outside of the role can feel daunting, if you don't already have a lot of practice on the role and in the individual champions you tend to fail really hard.

&#x200B;

One thing that riot has been doing to jungle is adding champions from other lanes into the role (which has gone... okay?), this helps players by giving them a gateway into the role. I think something similar could be done with support it would just be a lot harder since it's not exactly possible to make zed or darius a support champion. Making someone a jungler is WAY easier than making someone a support. However, I don't think making a support is possible.

&#x200B;

Lets think about this; what makes a support? Free stats, CC, ***VISION***. 

Vision is the main component here, I think its a GREAT way to actually give some champions a way into the support role. First champion I think of, Teemo. Give teemo shrooms 2 minute of stealth after they expire, EX: After five minutes and the teemo shroom ""dies"" for the next two minutes it remains as an unclearable ward. Another champion I think of is Ivern (bush, shields, ETC)... however seeing as he's already an enchanter I don't think giving him a support flex would do much good. Actually one thing that did come to mind was giving lee sin a better AP ratio on his shield so he can build enchanter items... but that sounds HORRIBLY problematic (it's a funny thought).

&#x200B;

I think part of what support uninteresting to other playerbases is that its not very flashy, as a support the closest thing you have to an insec is a Janna flash+ult (which is suicide 90% of the time). I think adding new supports over time that are more mechanical could attarct more players to the role, as a whole supports tend to be on the easier side mechanically, but I think this is more because making a champion who has to lane like a support, while warding like a support, and doing other supportive things ALONG with having a high mechanical requirement would make the champion basically unplayable unless someone wanted to pour a crap ton of time into them. It's sorta just too much for one character to manage.",2021-05-01 12:02:21,0.0,n2aru1

67iivu39,DraconicMagia,"Honestly, the mindset and gameplay of Rekkles prior to joining G2 and even during much of the spring split reminds me a lot of the SCII champion Serral-the focus on mechanical perfection, standard builds and champions, very little openings to mistake in a standard macro game but in smaller cheese strats or unknown factors he might be vulnerable.   


It's just that it feels like in a more standard game of traditional marksman Rekkles feels like he's comfortable where he focuses on excellent positioning with long range and good kiting with little to no room for mistakes but at the same time less room for success either. A very safe playstyle.   


Serral had the same thing-he was focusing on more late game, macro intensive build orders that often made him very greedy and left his early game very weak and open to a lot of cheese.   


And I feel like it's something seen in pro plays where due to Rekkles preferring more scaling type marksman who rely on later game damage and strength it leaves him open to more exploitation in the early game.   


During the recent games though when he's been duoing with Miky, he's been trying a lot of new champs to get out of his comfort zone, much like Serral opened himself up to more early game cheese and aggressive strats to use instead of constant macro.

If you look at season 4, 5, 6 you can tell it was him, based on the irelia, kennen, ryze, renekton games. Also, since I'm guessing it was a secondary account, it makes sense that he didn't bring it up to challenger, but he did hit masters once.

i started playing LoL for the first time around 3-4 weeks ago. After many hours of guides about roles and basics, i decided i wanna learn how to jungle. I watched numerous guides, streams and videos about the basics of playing jungle, so i am not totally clueless.

BUT: How can I improve and learn without losing my sanity? It´s like every game at some point someone starts flaming me because i didnt do what he wanted me to do. Bot Lane loses 2v2 - my fault, mid laner resets, loses plates cause he got poked out of lane - my fault, top lane screws up his own minion wave. - you are right... somehow my fault?! NOBODY provides ANY wards or vision... my fault - i start getting sick of it.

I admit i am still somewhat lost after my first full clear including one crab, but i try to improve, thats why i have some questions.

1) How do i decide which lane i am going to gank?  Only go for the over extending enemies? Or should i try to support the lane which is already ahead so he/she can snowball more and faster? Should i try to help the losing lane? 

2) When am i supposed to go for dragon etc? Everytime its up or only if bot has prio or when the majority of the enemy team is dead? Same for Baron/ Herold?

It would be really cool if it were possible to track the number of “saves” a player achieved. Supports would love this stat but it wouldn’t be exclusive to them. 
It’s so rewarding to save an ally from death and it would be cool to see it recognized.

What constitutes a save?

bv43yvol,TheBattlegoose,"Wall of text incoming, you have been warned:

TL;DR: Give J4 appropriate base stats and give him a real W ability and passive.

In regards to the in my opinion quite unreasonable buffs in the last recent patches such as the one to Rumble's passive or granting Sett’s w twice the AD ratio I’d like to bring attention to a champion that I feel has been feeling the powercreep the most over the last seasons, Jarvan.

The item rework was incredibly favorable for Jarvan as Goredrinker and the new Titanic Hydra are much stronger for him than the old Hydra and Cleaver combo as well as Sterak's now not being linked to one's Base AD (though you could argue Cinderhulk was better than the new Sunfire versions on him). Yet everyone who plays this champion will immediately notice how J4's kit is extremely lacking when it comes to damage especially later on in the game. Playing him in the jungle his clear is slow and unhealthy (funnily enough I remember his E lost armor back in Season 4 because it made his clear too healthy apparently, now he is one of the few champs that loses health while clearing), playing him in lane against most matchups is a battle uphill as you will get outscaled by pretty much anything even if you are ahead or even got outscaled in the loading screen depending on the matchup. Your W and E don't even receive reduced cooldowns when you max them suggesting Jarvan is an extremely early game champion (and to be quite honest after Level 2 Jarvan has already surpassed his biggest power spike for the entire game).

Let's take a look at some curiosities: Viego's Q has 600 range while J4's Q has 785 Range but Viego has 225 auto attack range while J4 sports a much longer weapon and only 175 auto attack range. Viego also has more sustain from his kit AND from HP regen while getting more HP and armor than a champion who has 0 additional defensive stats from his kit besides a meager shield. Yet Jarvan's supposed to be the frontline champion, though his base stats are incredibly mediocre which I think is a relict of both his W being an actual skill and his E granting bonus armor back in the old days.

But what about J4’s kit or rather the lack thereof: Did you know that J4's passive auto deals a whopping 8% of a target's current hp on a 6 seconds cooldown per target while Viego's Q at max rank makes all of his autos deal 6% of a target's current hp as a passive besides its active effect? There are so many possible ways to make J4's passive actually passable such as making the damage scale up with levels or granting it an AD ratio or shifting the current % hp to max % hp or giving it extra range or an uncancelable windup or letting it proc on structures again or giving it a higher minimum damage (at least vs champions) than 20 instead of having a shitty singular BORK proc on a cooldown that's trying to reward you for changing targets midfight and it’s not like Jarvan has overbearing amounts of damage left in his kit:

Besides one of the weaker passives in the game Jarvan also runs around with basically 2 abilities: his Q and his ultimate as his W can’t really be counted as an ability (rather a glorified garbage slow with tiny shield, the only good part about it is the shieldbash proc) and his E is more of a passive AS boost than an active ability as it most often is comboed with his Q. Ever since they nerfed W‘s HP ratio it is laughable how horrible this ability is. Again multiple options such as giving it a better slow, or base shield, or ratio, be it AD, HP, level or anything defensive such as resistances or damage reduction.

His E for whatever reason has an archaic AP ratio on it and even if they cared enough to give it an AD ratio it wouldn't matter half the time since you often have to position it in a way where you won't apply the flag's damage as you want to prioritize the knock up and suddenly you only benefit from the AS bonus. I suppose if the ability was blessed with an AD ratio it would be cancerous in lane as it's almost impossible to dodge it. It could be changed though where hitting a knock up on targets would apply E damage to them if it hasn't hit already.

The Q is amazing, don't get me wrong, with long reach, fast animation, high base damage and a 120% bonus AD ratio with AoE and armor reduction and a 0,75 second knock up gapcloser and so is the AoE damage point and click gapcloser with 150% bonus AD ratio ult and „impassable“ terrain (at least against immobile flashless opponents) though the base damage is actually quite meager with 200/325/450 so the ability’s main worth lies within its „crowd control“ in a game where more and more champions can easily escape it. Not to mention that ever since his ultimate got changed to deal AoE damage the damage is now avoidable by flashing (or dashing quickly enough). Rek'Sai's ultimate initially could also be dodged after her rework but the mechanic was changed to never miss because it is point and click and the caster of the ability had no impact on whether or not such an important skill would hit. I feel like at least the initial target of the point and click of Jarvan’s ultimate should not be able to flash the incoming damage. Or make it a free moblity skillshot and reward the user more for hitting it.

Jarvan to me is one of the few champions that offers fair and clear counterplay (so much that certain suggestions here try to remove parts of it) and so I am left wondering why Riot is not trying to promote him instead of other champions with far less desirable gameplay. The only reason J4 is even close to viable is because engaging onto squishy key targets right now is insanely valuable as pretty much any follow up by your team will blow up enemy carries and win the teamfight right then and there. Jarvan by himself on the other hand is absolutely pathetic unless you somehow got so far ahead that you can slap your opponents to death after using your entire 2 abilities on them and waiting for 1 of them to come off cooldown.",2021-05-01 09:49:15,0.0,n28k1t

otrl8,Vangorf,"This rune is so insanely overtuned, producing pretty much 100 healing/min itself alone, and its being comboed with Resolve tree and Doran shield meaning the given champion can completely ignore any kind of poke (especially if they have some sort of healing in their kit or can get an early Vamp Scepter). The most notable examples are Yasuo, Yone, Viego, Kassadin and Akali getting completely free laning phases scaling into legit monsters. And before any op.gg detective comes out: yes I just lost to a Tryndamere mid, who healed 1200 HP in 12 minutes. By the end of the game he healed for 7000 hp in total. For comparison their Soraka healed 10 000 hp. Sure its fine and balanced... Mages simply cant answer the gameplay pattern produced by this ""combo"", as they run out of mana and their kits cant produce enough DPS to keep up with the healing, but on the otherhand they cant burst from 100 to 0 without the enemy being able to answer back in some form. 

I think Fleet's sustain should be cut to 33% (for both melees and ranged champs) against minions, so it stayst a short trade sustaint rune vs CHAMPIONS (as Conqueror serves as the long trade rune) but not letting certain champions have completely free laning phases.",2021-05-01 06:23:28,0.0,n24yjj
kombuof,Gentzer,"Hello, neckbeards and skin collectors! It's midseason! Which as we all know is Riot speak for: It's the MSI patch so 2/3 of it is weak shit so the meta doesn't snap in two behind our backs for the tournament...intentionally.

So what better way than to liven up some dull patch notes than to give you the truth behind the nerfs!

**Diana**

So it turns out than when you make generic changes to a champion's stats and abilities in order to specifically make them able to jungle, you also end up buffing their lane as well. Crazy right? Anyway Diana's getting hit with some of those generic stat nerfs so hopefully she oneshots you at the appropriate Level 6 rather than any earlier.

**Dr. Mundo**

Aight, we're gonna be real here, Mundo is getting reworked soon...ish. We just want Mundo to not be THAT good so we don't end up with another fucking Aatrox situation where people think the old kit was actually good because the 3 weeks it was actually viable was the 3 weeks before the rework.

**Garen**

So we heard you guys really hated going against an AD Juggernaut top laner, who builds Stridebreaker, nukes you for true damage, requires 3.142 brain cells to play, and attacks with a bladed weapon. As a result, we have nerfed Garen. You may begin applauding now.

**Gragas**

Ol' Graggy's been lifting!...For about 5 minutes. Apparently this has somehow reduced his weight by some minor amount and so he weighs slightly fewer tons when he slams into you.

**Hecarim**

Boss I swear to god, this better kill this Friendship is Magic looking motherfucker I am sick of talking about him in patch notes about how the latest wimpy nerf will totally stop Hecarim shitting on the game...wait is this the notes now? SHI-

So we decided to finally do something about Hecarim - the Rito special. We're nerfing Hecarim's main item, AND we're going hard on Hecarim nerfs. The classic ""nuke the base values and add damage scaling to kill tank builds"" approach should do the trick. If Hecarim is still somehow the best jungler in the game after this then we give up.

**Heimerdinger**

Sorry Heimer mains, but no one likes laning against you, go sit in the corner with the Yorick mains...Uhhh, Yorick main that is.

**Jinx**

Fishbones didn't get the memo that it's Season 11 and crits shouldn't be dealing 200% damage anymore. We trusted Jinx to tell Fishbones given its her gun but surprisingly she wasn't very trustworthy on that. Our b.

**Kayn**

In a freak accident, it appears general consensus is that Assassin Kayn is superior to Darkin Kayn. In order to bring balance to the universe, we're buffing Darkin.

**Kindred**

Kindred heard Death's Dance was getting improved, and somehow thought that was referring to them. As a result of this terrible mixup, Lamb and Wolf were recently seen taking dance lessons. These have resulted in some small improvement to Dance of Arrows, but apparently they do a beautiful Waltz now too.

**Kog'Maw**

Look, we know these aren't big buffs, but just scroll down a bit and you can see we're buffing Lulu on this patch too, which honestly is the biggest buff we can give to Koggles really.

**Lulu**

Look, we know these aren't big buffs, but just scroll up a bit and you'll see we're buffing Kog'Maw on this patch, which is the biggest buff we can give to Lulu really.

**Morgana**

Good news everyone! Morgana is a viable jungler now!

Bad news! Turns out her W has become the ""Best Clear in the Game"" button which was a bit much. We're turning the notch down to ""One of the Best Clears in the game"" which is much more reasonable.

**Rumble**

We're nerfing Rumble for 2 reasons here. Firstly, because of his mid-lane shenanigans dunking on our money making melee mids. Secondly, some ""geniuses"" were talking about Nashor's Tooth Rumble when we buffed his on-hit and we're gonna nip that in the bud because no one wants to see that shit.

**Sett**

Gonna be honest, totes forgot this guy existed until we caught an intern watching JoJo on his break and remembered he existed. It's probably his turn to be meta again and I can't be assed to check so have some buffs Sett.

**Shen**

It's MSI time, and Shen isn't seeing much play in pro, this is of course, completely unacceptable, so we're buffing him.

**Taric**

After a few years of Taric/Yi ruining both individual games, the meta, pro play, and several keyboards, we finally decided to listen to the overwhelming feedback to nerf the interaction between Taric's stun and Yi's Alpha Strike. Let's pat ourselves on the back for correcting this problem with uncharacteristic swiftness.

**Trundle**

Just wanna point out that the patch note for this spotlights that Trundle got nerfed in 8.18, buffed on 10.2, and now getting a follow-up buff on 11.9, suggesting Trundle only gets any changes approximately once every 18 months, which is the real troll here.

**Vladimir**

We forgot Vladimir was so frustrating to go against when we buffed him last patch. The guy who pushed for the buff was reminded when he lost his Bronze promos to Vlad and we won't make such a mistake again for AT LEAST 6 words.

Here's to not overbuffing frustrating mages!

**Xerath**

On a completely unrelated note, here's some meaty Xerath buffs! Look forward to getting repeatedly chunked and nuked by a champion whose miles away so that you can't reach or meaningfully interact with him in any way! We forsee no issues with this.

**Items**

Honestly even I can barely read these changes without glazing over so I'll give you the dumb version.

Blah blah Dead Man's, blah blah stats, blah blah targeting, blah blah heal.

The only ones worth talking about are of course:

**Turbo Chemtank**

After constant opinions from players that Turbo Chemtank is the main problem with champions like Udyr and Hecarim, and said champions continuing to dominate even after direct nerfs, we gonna try hitting Chemtank here. Honestly this is seems like a longshot to me but hey, who the fuck cares?

Compensation buffs? What the fuck are those?

**Wit's End**

After taking an item with underrated value and attractive stat profiles and completely jury-rigging the hell out of its passives and stat profiles, turns out the item is dogshit and no one wants it. So we're gonna put some lipstick on this pig and pray to god Wit's End is some hidden gem again.

**Misc.**

The rest is your usual round of bugfixes which I won't even bother going into here because you either A: Don't read the bugfixes or B: Only read the bugfixes to get annoyed when the latest god-awful client bug hasn't been fixed so why waste the text.

Shouldn't a tank, well tank? Not oneshot squishies while being next to unkillable? (I know that ADC's counter tanks but usually it takes extended fights to be able to kill a tank while some tanks can just flash onto the ADC and oneshot them.)

I learned clear times, which junglers could solo which objectives, when top lane would ward and how to get around them, and a ton of other stuff I would NEVER have learned playing purely Top Lane. I then played Gwen in the jungle for 2 weeks after her release to learn her but thats not the point of the post.

This week i've transitioned back to being a top laner after being out of the lane for 3 years. And holy shit I feel so powerful with all that knowledge.

I wanted a clash finder that is automatic. Meaning, you should only have to type in your summoner name to recruit or find teammates; no account creation and no manual team creation. Check out the app I made here: [https://asobi.gg/clash](https://asobi.gg/clash).

&#x200B;

**If you are looking for a team to play with:**

All you have to do is type in your summoner name, and Asobi will show you all of the teams looking to fill up their roster. You will be able to see everything you need: team name, team tier, team members, how many people they are looking for, and what roles they are looking for. You will be able to see each team member’s basic stats, but if you want to see more detailed stats, you can click on their name and it will take you to their opgg. To interact with the team, just comment on their post. 

&#x200B;

**If you are a team looking to recruit teammates:** 

If you haven’t done so, create your team in the League of Legends client first, then hop to Asobi and type in your summoner name. We will be able to retrieve your team’s info and you’ll be given an option to start recruiting. Once you click Recruit, you will be taken to a page where you will see your team’s info as well as all of the summoners looking to join a team. You will be able to see their basic stats, but if you want to see more detailed stats, you can click on their name and it will take you to their opgg. You can invite each summoner to join your team with a click of a button. 

&#x200B;

**Notifications:** 

Because I know most of you uses discord, I put a feature in there where you can insert in your Discord webhook url, and Asobi will send all of the notifications to your chosen Discord server. 

&#x200B;

**Tournament automation**

After each clash tournament, the app will automatically update to the next upcoming clash tournament and filter out all of the old teams. That means, you don't have to worry about interacting with a team that will never respond to you. The teams you see are all new and actively looking to recruit teammates. 

&#x200B;

**Does it cost money to use this:**

No, it’s completely free. I built this for the community to use.

&#x200B;

**Feedback:**

Because I built this all by myself, you will most likely encounter issues/bugs. You guys report them in the app, and I will try my best to fix them. 

That’s it, I hope everyone enjoys the app!

843kn97g,JapaneserScrooge,"Since the item overhaul, especially with rod of ages being gone, I’ve found it hard to itemize mana-intensive tanks for early game. Particularly in ARAM you are basically forced to choose between rushing tank and being perpetually mana-deprived, or building mana and being squishy.

&nbsp;

As an example, I feel this pain the most playing Chogath in ARAM. Basically the only mana item I feel I can build is frozen heart which is situational, and an early tear which I would probably sell for something better late game. But during the early game I’m basically stuck with 0 mana once I cast 3 ruptures.

&nbsp;

Essentially, why do we have an armor+mana option, but no health+mana or MR+mana options?

&nbsp;

Edit:
I mentioned this in one of my comment replies, which I'll add in. We have a number of combinations of tank stats + other stats, which I'll list below:

&nbsp;

Health + Armor (deadman's, randuins)

Health + MR (Abyssal, Spirit Visage, Force of Nature)

Health + Health (Warmogs)

&nbsp;

Mana + Armor (frozen heart)

Mana + MR (N/A)

Mana + Health (N/A)

&nbsp;

We used to have RoA and Abyssal fill the last two spots, but with the removal/changes of those items we now are left with nothing. Seems strange to me that Riot didn't replace them with anything. I get that there's workarounds but building early mana items just to sell them off for something more useful later seems like something Riot would want to minimize.",2021-04-30 22:23:40,1.0,n1uxkv

vyqjp,IgorPasche,"Stridebreaker and Gale Force.

Everybody hates those items, especially Stridebreaker. They give an ability to champions in which they were DESIGNED not to have. For example, if you go on League's website and search for ""juggernauts"" as a class, you'll see that they're supposed ""to deal considerable damage and tank some, hence why they lack mobility"" (something along those lines). It was purposefully made this way to BALANCE those champions. What's the point of this definition if League now has an item that goes against this very philosophy for this class of champions?

And the worst part is that they won't address the real issue. I'm 100% sure they're going to nerf those champions damages instead of removing/nerfing these mobility actives. I mean, I'm no Darius fan, but last season he was at least somewhat kiteable. Now he just kills you because he will (not an ""if"") get to you with a dash that also slows you (???), E and the rest is history.

On Gale Force, I don't think it's that much of an issue because it's currently very niche in a way (it's only good when enemy team has a lot of deadly skill shots), since Kraken Slayer and Shieldbow outclass it in every single shape and form and because it's built by immobile ADCs (Jhin mostly), champions that just evaporate. Also, the best usage of Gale Force I've seen so far was defensive, not offensive (unlike Stridebreaker).

na0so,itstingsandithurts,"I’ll preface by saying I’m by no means a game designer and don’t know the current design philosophies Riot have around Runes and how diverse they think they are or how they want them to be.

With the start of season 11 we saw a complete overhaul of the items system, with Riot stating they were working towards having a more diverse array of options to choose from for each game depending on your needs, aiming to have “[no champion choosing the same mythic in 75%+ of games](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-feb-26/)”. But does this philosophy extend to Key Runestones?

As you might have noticed, most champions in fact only choose one Key Runestone in 75%+ of their games (Plat+, 11.9), going by Riot's metric around item diversity. 91 out of 155 Champions choose the same Key Runestone in 75%+ of their games. For those who enjoy data sets I have compiled data from Lolalytics from Plat+ games on Patch 11.9 seen here:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x2CnOfvuHbar0rMa9v9E3itQHA1B1QBlqT7DXDcvAiA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x2CnOfvuHbar0rMa9v9E3itQHA1B1QBlqT7DXDcvAiA/edit?usp=sharing).

This illustrates exactly how few options players have when it comes to Runes. Note: I only used data from Champions main roles, except where there was a close to even split in pickrate between roles *and* the runes had a differing pick rate in each role, e.g. Gragas and Dr. Mundo, to weed out skewed data.

There are a few outliers here and there, for example Nasus, Azir, and Teemo all had their most commonly picked rune chosen less than 40% of the time, but conversely some champions such as Leblanc, Olaf and Karthus picking their respective runes in greater than 99% of their games. Where is the diversity in this?

I’m not saying every champ should be able to pick every single rune and be fine with it, but *most* champions are shoehorned into a single rune, and build creativity is stifled before you even load onto the rift. This isn’t looking at any other tier of rune either, for example how Ravenous Hunter was a must for a lot of Champions earlier this year, and thankfully was addressed, now I would like to see some other runes see some attention and make rune choices matter again.

Now that the point has been made, some interesting points of data I found while working on this:

**Edit** So I messed up the Azir runes, and reddit won't let me edit lower than this line for some reason, but the last dot point below is not correct.

* Skarner takes Omnistone more often than any other champion at 0.6% of his games.
* Renekton has taken Arcane Comet twice this patch and has a 100% winrate with it.

[https://preview.redd.it/0hc2o7y8p3w61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=489a1ebfecc4389122241e8a11b06b23456da3b2](https://preview.redd.it/0hc2o7y8p3w61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=489a1ebfecc4389122241e8a11b06b23456da3b2)

* Janna has a pretty even split of taking Summon Aery(48.4%) and Arcane Comet(42.6%) in her games, and Comet only has a 0.5% greater winrate making both runes equally viable.
* Gragas potentially has the highest Key Runestone diversity across all 3 of his roles, with Predator, Grasp of the Undying and Aftershock being the most picked in each role, Electrocute, Dark Harvest, Comet and Summon Aery also being viable.
* LeBlanc has the least diversity with taking Electrocute in 99.4% of her games.
* Senna was one of two champions who took Glacial Augment in a statistically significant manner, at 43.5% of her games, the next highest being Janna at 8.2%.
Conqueror is the most picked rune overall at 20.6% across all champions.
* AP Shyvana with Dark Harvest makes up around 75% of her games despite having about a 4% lower winrate than AD Shyvana with a close to even split between Press the Attack and Conqueror.",2021-04-29 19:52:49,107.0,n12nm7

Morgana has a 57% ban rate for the 2nd patch in a row. The pool buffs to monsters just needs to be completely removed, make Morgana go back to her proper role as a support. Why does she need to be a triple flex pick, she holds a positive win rate in jungle support and mid.

The worst part is she's not even supposed to be a jungler she's just an abomination added for seemingly no reason at all. How many of you jungle mains out there are happy Morgana is now an S+++ tier jungler. I know I'm not so after finally getting my ban back since Hecarim wasn't holding it hostage now if I want to have fun and play jungle my ban is being held hostage by Morgana.

I also think completely reworking the jungle like is being suggested for next patch is one of the most troll moves I've seen in a long long time. I took lots of time to learn proper clears and timings for my pathing and now it's all likely to be worthless. The idiots wonder why noone mains jungle, REALLY. Maybe because you completely change the role every 3 months. Buffing and nerfing champs is one thing but completely changing how the role works during the season instead of during the off season where junglers have a chance to learn is really dumb.

Thank you so much for the game and I understand that it takes a lot of effort to maintain and improve it. Still, I have one request. It probably sounds cheeky. The game has a lot of characters with outdated models (Riven, LeBlanc, Katarina, Soraka and others). I can see you fixing things like this and updating your heroes regularly. Thank you again for that.

However, the outdated model is not as sad as the replicas of the characters. There are a lot of them in the game and some of them have quite a lot of phrases and such characters are interesting to listen to. They are cool to play because of their words alone (Pantheon, Atrox, Volibir, Kled). Many of the old champions have not changed their phrases for a long time. The same LeBlanc has replicas from the time of the concept of summoners in the lore of the League and this is very sad.

It's hard to play on a character when he has at most 3-5 replicas. I really like to listen and feel the character while playing. However, this is not always possible.

When I win the lane I seem to lose the game more often than I win. When I lose the lane I seem to win more often than I lose. My thinking behind this is ADC does absolutely fucking nothing if your team is behind.

So you give ""strategic"" kills to the enemy ADC and support so that the 3 roles that actually make a difference (support is actually a great role but it's lumped in with ADC here because I'm lazy) are able to come get free kills on the bot lane when ever they feel like because ADC's are dog shit and can't 1v1 my nan. 

In doing so you get the 3 roles that need to be ahead for the ADC to play the game ahead. From then you actually start playing the game.

Riot, get started doing something with the game. Rewrite it so that there were fewer mistakes, also give some protection against smurfs and people spoiling the game.

Why do you want to penalize doggies when you see we have trolls in the lobby?

so firstly an item made of

\- Aegis of the legion  (1500g)

\- 2 Amplifying Tomes (870)

and an extra 330 gold so it adds up to 2700 gold

This item would give 10 AHS, 35mr and armor, 40 AP and a passive that reads something like deal more damage to enemies you have higher overall HP then. The passive would be the real benefit of this so things like katarina can't abuse it easily

&#x200B;

secondly i think we can have an item made of

\-Kindlegem 2x (1600)

\- Blasting Wand (850)

\- And an extra 150 gold to make it 2600 gold

This item would give 20 AHS, 450 hp, and 45 AP and an active that reads when below 35% hp increase the healing you recieve and gain MS or something like that

3b4m65ms,NOTanOldTimer,"Appearance  
Little boy, younger than Nunu, holds a slingshot for a weapon and has a satchel for his stuff/ammo, wears normal clothes, brown cargo shorts and a white t-shirt and has a bowl cut haircut. His name is Aris (short from Aristotelis)  


Lore  
Aristotelis was born in Piltover and he is a product of a forbidden love between two rival gang members. Despite getting raised by ""mafia society"" he is very well behaved and with proper manners and very mature for his age. Also received a lot of target training from his father with his slingshot. And a lot of survival training from his mother. During an all out war between the gangs, his parents went missing with 0 traces of what happened to them. Aris now is looking for them and his clues have led him to summoners rift in order to find the one responsible for his parents disappearance.  


Passive  
Aris can move while auto attacking, meaning, when you click for him to move somewhere he will start going to that place and you can press the attack button for him to attack something that is in his range without him stopping his movement, basically he is constantly on the move.  


Q  
Active: Change ammo between marbles and sharp rocks shards  
Passive: You can charge your auto attacks to hit harder (extra physical damage) and apply extra effects according to the ammo you use.   
Marble ammo apply stun per target champions have cd to how often it can occur to them) and sharp rocks apply grievious wounds. While marbles are on target autos, sharp rocks hit in a line aoe until target is reached, meaning they will hit everything in their path applying grievious wounds until the on click target is met.  


Mechanically this can be done with either two methods with both of them having pros and cons  


Method 1 - draw back the mouse when you click to attack:  
when you right click to attack, you will be able to hold the click and draw back the mouse to essentially draw your slingshot more and release the projectile upon release of the right click.  
pros of this method are that its not restricted by anything other than pure player swiftness, the faster the player moving the mouse is the faster he will be able to do it over and over again so he will land multiple hard hitting autos  
cons are that your mouse will must move a specific way so you will be locked for that mouse movement and wont be free to click somewhere else unless you cancel early the charging  


Method 2 - click and hold for charging:  
you right click and just hold it down until it charges  
pros are that your mouse is free to move around and you just have to hold the attack button pressed  
cons are that this is limited by your attack speed  


With the combination of Aris' passive and his Q passive, Aris can attack something that will be out of his range (basic range 550) as long as it was in his range when he clicked on it to start charging the attack and as long as he has vision of the target. Also , his sharp rocks ammo charged attack will be as big as he can make it if he clicked to charge and then moved away, the line will be as big as the distance between him and the target upon release of attack button.   


His basic attacks have minor effects from the ammo, meaning, marble ammo simple attacks apply a 0,25 sec stun on everything that can be stunned (enemy champs obviously will have a cd timer for it)  
while a charged marble attack will add 0,5 sec to that.  
sharp rocks ammo will have a 10% grievious wounds effect as a basic attack and a charged attack will add another 20%  


W  
A quick mini dash (like half the range kayn's dash is) that while he does the animation he will be untargetable and also release himself from root crowd control  


E  
Active: gives you a shield for a couple seconds that scales with your physical damage  
Passive: gain bonus movement speed and attack speed whenever you get attacked while the shield effect is active, every new received attack renews the buffs  


R  
Active: for a limited amount of time gain 100 range and all your attacks are automatically full charged  
Passive: you can move through units

b0nuiaoh,Consistent-Onion4613,"Hi, so I usually didn't find that many problems with the game up until these couple of months where the game feels frustrating to say the least. For context I have played this game for a long time, have followed pro play and have enjoyed and loved it through out the years. Now, this feeling is changing a bit in the past year and watching the patch changes, or the new idea proposed for the dodging problem made me wonder what's the idea behind these changes, because rarely anyone, pro/coach/regular player thinks most of the changes are good. To give some context of my thinking I would talk about some recent patches or the problem with dodging.

First of all it often feels like champions who are really strong, borderline over powered don't get touched and even if they do, the nerf doesn't apply to the thing that makes the champion strong. For example yone, viego, katarina, got some touches over the past few patches, katarina even got buffed at some point, but champions like these roll on everyone every game. Every time I face a yone who literally one taps me even though he is 0/3 with just boots completed i feel like my hard work to win the lane and go 20cs up doesn't matter just because his champion is way stronger. This feeling is repeated when tristana, who has been in a completely op state for months now hasn't been touched at all, and if she is mid she can all in me lvl 2 and just shred me, and if I leave lane for 10s, boom my turret is at 50% hp. Talking in this direction i would mention rell or seraphine, who are so frustrating to play against. Rell got such a little nerf to het stun, that doesn't even come close to the real problem with her, which is an insane engage, which if u don't predict, combined with her W- R there is literally no counterplay. Or when i think of toplane i just think of a darius, a garen, or champions that used to be kitable, and when they got on you, okay you lost, they will melt you, but now they are unkitable, the only counteplay to them is negated by Stridebreaker, and the moment they pick that up u will get run down no matter what. Another point is the fact that the nerfs and  buffs are so not needed somewhere, for example the heimer nerf. What the hell was that? I swear i have played around 400 games this season and i have seen heimer in 5 games, in which he didnt even dominate, but okay let's nerf him. Or the new nerf on vladimir? 0.5s off his Q, yeah, that will get him, he still is perma picked or perma banned and it's so frustrating that your chance of winning are really low the moment he goes through and gets picked by the enemy. Furthermore hecarim was just the most insane champ in the game with turbo and dead mans, but now, turbo got nerfed, same as dead mans, hecarim got nerfed and the champion is probably unplayable if not in perfect situations for him. In conclusion about this point, i feel like the nerfs/buffs aren't looked at through gameplay, but through statistics, and if anyone here reading this knows a thing or two about statistics, is  that they often aren't the only thing we should base our conclusions on a certain topic.

Moving on to the dodging problem, I think the problem isn't the same in high and lower elo. In high elo the problem with dodging is that the queues themselves are extremely long, and the players know each other and if they have been in the same queue before they will ban out the onetricks which will result in someone firstiming a champion (which will make a teammate dodge) or they will dodge themselves. In high elo, draft matters aswell, beacuse the teams have players with similar skill level and there isn't often a huge gap in one lane. Compare this to lower elo, im talking Diamond and lower, there is always a gap in one or two lanes, there is always that one player who is autofilled and picks a high skill champion, or a player who is firstiming. There is always a player who is griefing in these ways or who is on a massive lose streak that you know that playing with him will most likely result in a loss. With that said, i would like to say that in my opinion, the reporting system working in the first place should be the first thing of action riot should take. Because we all know, and we have all witnessed a griefer, a soft inter or a straight up troll gets to queue up again and again, but if you say something back to these players, you will get punished by the system. 

Fix the reporting system, punish the trolls, don't balance the game based on statistics or pro play only and work out a plan that will resolve these issues which we all experience.",2021-05-01 00:24:36,0.0,n1xh6d

pdd1cz5,Psyr1x,"To preface, Riot has stated the skins are [not a 1:1 translation](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1387109101314797570) of the tarot cards.  Inspiration was taken from multiple cards.  However, apparently there will be a [cosmology](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1387108157344817152) attached to each skin.

While I'm a bit miffed that they aren't truly each representing 1 of the tarot cards, I do hold hope that Riot is making their own ""variants""/versions and assigning their own meanings to them..... and maybe in the future, we'll have a full deck to do our own custom readings.

&#x200B;

Taking this into account, I've thought it'd be cool to analyze the inspirations present for each skin and judge how well they translate to the lore of the character.  It is important to note that the tarot are not an objective singular meaning.  Each card has multiple meanings and interpretations, although they follow a common theme.  Their significance also varies based on whether the cards are read Upright or Reversed.  For the purposes of this analysis, the cards will be assumed to be Upright.

&#x200B;

# Camille

The cards that seem to be present in her aesthetic, or stand out the strongest, are The High Priestess, The Empress, and The Hanged Man.  Arguably The Moon is also present as a card inspiration itself.We see the High Priestess' presence in the crescent moons present within Camille's splash, as well as the pomegranate upon her throne.  The Empress is evoked through the commanding stature upon the throne and the starred crown.  In her recall we see a blatant representation of The Hanged Man, we also see a Full Moon.

I would say taken cohesively, they represent her pretty well.

The Empress represents fertility in exploits, opulence and wealth.  The Hanged Man represents the ultimate sacrifice or martyrdom.  The High Priestess is a card representing insight, wisdom, and intuition. Finally, The Moon represents inner turmoil, insecurity and hidden secrets with conflicts.

These all work together well to paint a portrait of Camille... As the head of Clan Ferros, she's a successful business woman.  She also governs Piltover from the shadows and is an intelligencer.  
She sacrificed herself for her job giving up notions of love and even aspects of her humanity in the efforts to becomes someone who could perfectly do what needs to be done.  However, she also possesses a conflicting element to herself, not just in the compromise of what she's become, but more literally in where her heart is, as the emergent Brackern consciousness presents itself, making the inner turmoil more literal.

&#x200B;

# Xerath

The cards that most strongly appear in Xerath's skin seem to be The Devil and The Tower, with The Devil being seen by the horned imagery, and The Tower metaphorically being represented by the shape language, and the suit/armor falling to pieces around his form.  Some nods to The Sun and The Magician may also be present, seen in the elaborate arching piece around the shoulders, and the magical energy of Xerath's hands.

I'd say these also fit him quite well.

The Devil speaks to enslavement, bondage, and materialism. Whereas The Tower speaks to catastrophic change, destruction, and upheaval.  The potential nods to The Sun would speak to enlightenment, vitality, and success.  What may be drawn from the possible Magician is a reading of personal skill, determination, and personal agency.

Xerath was born a slave before being taken in by Azir.  He was offered the chance to learn great magics and had access to considerable knowledge.  However, while he was considered a brother by Azir, he remained a slave.  Embittered, he resorted to convincing Azir to seek Ascension, where he plotted to steal that power for himself.  Usurping the ritual, Xerath Ascended to a level of godhood never before seen, destroying the capital and precipitating Shurima's downfall.  He was sealed in a sarcophagus that quickly shattered, unable to truly contain his power, after which he was locked in a vault where he and Renekton would be trapped for millennia.  Eventually becoming freed, he now presides over part of Shurima seeking to rule and destroy the few who remain from the ancient empire.

# Tahm Kench

Tahm bears a somewhat unusual appearance in his skin, and evokes aesthetics of The Emperor, The Chariot, and The Devil.  
The Emperor is clearly pointed to via the crown.  The Devil is also immediately recognizable due to the horns.  The Chariot comes to mind due to the almost vehicle-like nature of his form, with the shape being in the outline of a chariot.   The lack of identifiable animal-like features beyond the teeth further emphasizes this.  It might also be that The World is present in his aesthetic inspiration, not just due to the rotund nature of The Kench, but also the swirling magical fog framing the splash art.

Similarly to the previous members, this represents our River King pretty well.

The Emperor represents power and authority.  It also speaks to success and promotion.  As referenced before The Devil speaks to bondage and enslavement, but this doesn't have to be literal as it also speaks to temptation and materialism, as well as unhealthy relationships.   The Chariot evokes journey and ambition, the drive or desire for something.  Finally, The World represents possibilities.

Tahm Kench is a demon of gluttony and addiction, an entity who feeds on excess to the point of negativity.  He appeals to desperation and hunger, a craving for ""more"", no matter the cost, something  that eventually results in the person being consumed by their greed and addiction, devoured by Tahm.  
Tahm Kench is also a being who offers possibilities, and the paths to achieving them (for a time).   He is ultimately, however, always a negative, and there will be costs for dealing with him.

&#x200B;

# Lucian

Lucian was a harder draw to determine.  At first glance, The Sun, shining brightly, is prominent in his splash.  At closer inspection, the scales are also visible... a clear indication towards Justice. The cocking of the guns: One directed to the viewer, the other held up in a nonthreatening manner, also evoke themes of Justice.  Lucian's pose itself, and the angle we are presented, is one that is strongly reminiscent of Judgement.  There is a possibility that The Tower is also meant to be evoked in his design, as several feature prominently in his splash.

At first read, I'm somewhat conflicted about how well they gel with Lucian as a character.

Justice is somewhat self explanatory, it speaks to balance, fairness, and responsibility.  It also speaks to ""cause and effect"" and consequences.   The Sun speaks not only to vitality, as previously referenced with Xerath, but also marriage, joy, and clarity.  Judgment speaks to choices.  It involves strong decisions coming up that will heavily impact your life.   The Tower (of which there are several) speaks to upheaval and sudden drastic, and catastrophic, change... as well as upheaval... however, unlike Judgement, it is typically not change of conscious make/decision.

Lucian is a man defined by cycles of tragedy and moments of joy/love.  His father passing away led to him meeting Senna, and joining the Sentinels of Light, an order dedicated to stopping The Black Mists and reinstating order.  One he'd always had a desire of being part of.  Eventually he and Senna fell in love, and shared a prosperous relationship.  However, an encounter in the Isles led to Senna's soul being captured and Lucian's life falling to ruin.  Throwing himself into the pursuit of Thresh and revenge in the hopes of destroying Thresh to free his wife from eternal  torment or himself dying.  In a moment of clarity, Lucian instead stabs the lantern, resulting in the souls spilling out and Senna managing to eke herself from Thresh's bonds, returning her to Lucian's side.

In several ways, the cards are fitting, but it is also interesting to note that many hold more significant meaning when Reversed... something the numerous Towers (paired with Judgment) might actually encourage.

Reversed, The Tower speaks to losses and obstacles... something clearly present in his life.  Reversed, The Sun speaks to lack of joy/vitality as well as lack of clarity.  Similarly, Judgment reversed speaks to hasty and poorly thought out decisions, and lack of logical judgment.  It also refers to stagnation.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

All in all, these come across as pretty solid representations for each champion, and was a fun analysis.   While I do wish it'd been a more singular approach, taking inspiration from multiple cards does allow for a more complex and thorough reading of the baseline personalities and backstory theming of each champion.   I do however hope that when the skinline bios are released, they appeal to a central and unique theme such that in the future, we might have a full League ""tarot"" deck from which we can make unique readings.",2021-04-29 17:20:28,58.0,n10lkn

4kikhmh,ThatoneBetaman,"Starting out, I was actually looking forward to the reworked item system riot said that it would bring more ""diversity"" to builds and make more interesting combinations of items. Come day 1 of the season and every top laner built Sunfire Aegis, every bot laner built Shieldbow and mid laners cried about how useless their lane felt. Riot decided to remove/rework items that were integral to the playstyle of certain champions without giving anything in return. Even once items started to equal out in power, another issue arose. Champions who were balanced around their poor mobility were able to just build an item that would give them a dash (that also does damage), ADC's could build an item that made them go INVISIBLE after each takedown as well as slowing by 90% on their first auto. Champions who usually built multiple components before getting their first item were inherently nerfed due to the importance of getting a mythic early. Getting killed by a 300 damage undodgeable dash projectile from a Jhin is not something that should be happening ever, let alone every game. Am I alone in this? Does anyone like the new items and the state of the game currently? I'm genuinely curious to hear some other opinions on this",2021-04-30 09:18:59,4.0,n1j68y

This doesn't mean a champ that can 1v9. It means by nature of their gameplay, you're less prone to being upset. 

Aggressive, ambitious, early game champions seem to be the most tilting for me because they really want the lane phase to go well and are likely to be tp'd on or ganked. Feast or famine. They're also more prone to user error, mechanical mistakes. 
(Renekton, Lucian, Yasuo, Yone, Lee Sin and etc)

Conversely, champs that don't really care for solo plays and just want to scale seem to be way more conducive to chill gameplay overall. 
(Vladimir, Vel'koz, Xerath, Nasus, etc)

And then there's champs whose identities revolve around helping people. The bass guitarists of League. (Soraka, Ivern, Lulu, etc)

Not that I personally have a problem with an all Korean League, but is there a rule against non-Koreans in LCK? Or is it just that Korean teams aren't interested in hiring foreign talent? If we ever do end up seeing a non-Korean in LCK, who do you guys would hope that history-defining player will be?

Personally I don't believe we'll ever see a non-Korean player in LCK due to the local talent. The only candidate I can potentially see being in LCK is Nemesis, who recently moved to Korea after joining Gen-G as a streamer/content creator. Even then the chances Gen-G will move him into their roster would be incredibly small. After all Korean fans would likely be in outrage if a foreign player ended up playing in their domestic league, for example, when rumors spread about LS potentially joining T1 as a coach, fans were in outrage. Now the circumstances may be different for Nemesis, but I still find this unlikely.

\-It is very difficult for a Marksman or a jungler to be ranked below B tier. A jungler or Marksman has to be either exceptionally bad, or obviously never coming back into the meta except for very brief periods if they're below that point.

\-If a champion seems unlikely to return to the meta, they may be ranked lower. Maokai was chucked out the seed store once Ornn was added. The same thing happened to Orianna to a lesser extent.

\-Some champions are ranked a bit higher based on a period of time they crushed and defined the meta which sent ripples through how the game is played to this day, such as why Vi is C tier and not D or even F tier.

\-Many newer champions are included in B tier if I'm not sure yet whether or not Riot will want them to be a staple.

ftgad,infaredz,"Recently in ARAM, the by-far optimal build and *recommended* build in the shop is to go tear, Imperial Mandate and spam your W constantly to get procs. If Ashe builds Manamune after this, each individual arrow of the W hitting a champion who is unmarked will deal a minimum of \~300dmg. This might not seem too bad, but by level 9 Ashe's W is on much shorter cooldown than the Imperial Mandate passive, so the passive mark is applied instantly. This isn't even factoring in damage dealt to proc the mark by her team, in which case the 'effective' damage per W cast reaches up to \~450dmg per strike. On a 3s cooldown ability, that also slows, can hit *every member of your team*, and, in ARAM, is absolutely impossible to miss.

I can't find a single strategy to counterplay this, as she can walk up, press W, get the movespeed from mandate and disappear before I can even attempt to get closer. If she also takes Exhaust, as a lot do in ARAM these days, she can't be really be bursted once reached either.

**But Ashe could always build W spam, and it was never OP**! Yes, in previous seasons Ashe could still build Muramana, Black Cleaver etc and was still a nuisance. But two key differences in the new item update push the build over the edge:

* Ashe's W can now proc Muramana for extra damage. With the old build, she never autoattacked anyway, so the extra damage from MM that ONLY applied to autos was never converted. Now, since it always procs on ability casts, it adds a comfortable \~100dmg to EVERY W cast, increasing damage output massively. The new Manamune also gives Ability Haste, meaning she needs fewer items to reach spam heaven.
* Imperial Mandate grants both Ashe *and* her allies extra damage, generally to the entirety of your team, with every W. This means if you walk up anywhere close to the enemies or if they have long range poke, you are either dead or heavily chunked. Since Ashe comes online stupidly early now (IM + MM is all she needs), you can often be entirely pushed off your towers and concede inhib early because of this.

I think Mandate is strong, but only overpowered on Ashe. I really think that simply making Ashe more enjoyable and useful with an ADC build would solve a lot of this problem, but also increasing her W cooldown somehow or making Mandate scale with the *type* of CC (deals more damage, gives more movespeed etc for hard CC, slows do much less but still apply the mark). Alternatively, making it only possible to proc the passive on one champ at a time would seemingly resolve this problem without gutting the item too hard.

**Why listen to my opinion?** My username is Chub, and I have played over 4500 games of ARAM on EUW, over 8 years. According to WhatIsMyMMR, I am in the top 0.65% of ARAM players on the server.

**TLDR**: Ashe builds Imperial Mandate and Manamune and is completely unfair to play against. The new items synergise too well with her W spam build and insta-win games. Riot even *recommend* building this, instead of the ADC items Ashe SHOULD be building, if she wasn't in the gutter as a real ADC.

Attempting to climb the ranks feels desperate and broken, with little to no answers or support from the community, its easy to see why most people get frustrated. Even with the plethora of YouTube videos and coaching services out there, there is no real one size fits all answer to ""how do I climb?""

I am not saying that I play at a higher level than my actual rank (which most can agree might not be an actual reflection of your skill level) but I feel like I play at a higher level than my current rank. Silver 3. Obviously there are a world of things I can improve on, like my farming, Macro, Map awareness, Mechanical skill etc. But the requirements to play at a silver level don't include having 9+ cs per min. an amazing KDA etc. 

So why can't I get above Silver?

My real goal isn't to climb to gold and reap the end of season rewards. I want to reach a bit further, like finding an entry level - intermediate level team to participate in tournaments with so on so forth. I want to experience true League of legends team play and test my skill against other teams with complex strategies playstyles and synergies. I want to play knowing that my team mates have my back and I don't have to extend myself to cover for their lack of skill, knowledge or willingness to play. **I don't want to feel alone playing a team game, punishing myself for losing games, consistently experiencing negative emotions towards players I will never meet in my life.**

These feelings are amplified when things like this happen.

How am I suddenly losing 18 out of my 20 games played recently after reaching Silver 1 95 LP a few days ago?

I don't want pity from making this post, I want help. I want to know how I can find a team of players willing to take a Silver player and make them better, willing to invest the time in order to achieve a common goal. **I don't want to be gatekept from higher level teams because of my rank.**

But who wants a silver player on a team that is willing to put money on the line to compete in a tournament? Probably no one, because its the only tangible measure of your skill as a player, without doing advanced research, trial games, or coaching in order to determine if they are fit for your team.

The other biggest hurdle is **Finding a team.**

Finding a team on NA that is willing to practice consistently, with proper resources and without being on salary feels almost impossible. Most teams that pop up in common team finding websites are on the EUW Server. Unfortunately it is quite complicated to play with them because of time zones, ping, meta etc.

  

[Mostly French \/ European teams](https://preview.redd.it/392zla4bc8w61.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=c65da8b76f3cdf969f643067f80d4e1e384cd1f4)

To be honest I would give up climbing ranked if that meant a committed team would accept me. But a lot of serious teams demand that you are Diamond + which is an incredibly small amount of players. This is so weird to me because **you don't get good by getting to challenger then joining a pro team, its actually the other way around.** Most pro players will take what they have learned and play solo queue games armed with the knowledge and experience they have gained from playing at the highest level. Some don't even play solo queue.

I guess the TL;DR is: How will I find proper team mates to play with?",2021-04-30 11:35:37,1.0,n1lgbc

166b35,morisuh,"I just picked up the game again after several months and it looks like we’re still running on 2020 points, valid until August. How long do I have to EARN enough points for another 2020 Prestige skin, though?",2021-04-30 14:05:42,0.0,n1nnhq
buohxzej,Helpful_Ad1452,"I do not know what MMR is, other than the abbreviation for Match Making Rating. All I know is that everyone wants to milk MMR, more than they want to milk LP. So the only proposal I can give is to change the MMR system entirely: So that it still determines the skill level of players you be matched with, but also correlates directly to your LP so that everyone can see what skill level you are in. As a far as toxicity goes, the only thing I can propose is to link your MMR to your Honor System: The more sportsman you are then the more Ranks you have unlocked, this means that the higher up in ranks you go then the more sportsman the players should be to leave. The whole idea of this Ranked system is to leave the true behind in Elo Hell, so they can literally spend there entire games together stuck yelling at each other until they can learn to get over their differences and work with each other to win: Do I expect this to make everyone buddy and happy, no. I expect it to make your Rank worth way more, and completely destroy your ability to make a new account and smurf without having to go through milestones to get back to where you want to go: At the very least it should discourage making new account to escape punishment and farm ranked: You would value how far you have come in Ranked because you do not not to go through all of that again because of all the hard work you actually had to put on to be an Honorable player, then actually win a game, then be consistent because your Honor level now describes how good your terms are with Riot's Code of Conduct which will determine how far in Ranked you can go.  


1. Lock Ranks behind Honor Level (DO NOT CHANGE HOW HONOR WORKS, IT'S PERFECT FOR THIS)  
A. Honor Level 1 = Iron  
B. Honor Level 2 = Bronze - Gold  
C. Honor Level 3 = Platinum - Diamond  
D. Honor Level 4 = Master - Grandmaster  
E. Honor Level 5 = Challenger  

2. Change the MMR System too correlate with LP (A Somewhat better version of right now):  
A. Gain MMR and lose MMR by the amount of win and losses you have.  
Your First Ranked Game will give you 100 MMR for a win, or 0 MMR for a loss.  
After your first Ranked game, you will gain and lose MMR by the mean value of  
Your current MMR vs. the Highest MMR on the enemy team.  
This will still ensure your MMR has value in every digit (I.E. 462, 1099, etc.)  
B. Iron VI is 0-100 MMR then Iron I is 300-400 MMR,  
(Iron VI is 0-100 LP then Iron I is 300-400 LP)  
Masters VI would be 2,400-2,500 MMR then Masters I would be 2,700-2,800 MMR.  
(Masters VI would be 0-400 LP then Masters I would be 300-400 LP)  
Expect your Rank to rise and drop rapidly, and then peter-out over time  
In addition remember that you will be stuck under and Honor Level Cap but do not worry.  
Players in Iron with 5,000 MMR will not be matched with players in Iron with 300 MMR  
There will be a separation of wheat and chaff at all levels of play and ranks of play.  
This will be conducted by and MMR threshold, so all the player has to do is wait for their   
honor level.  
If a player has a higher MMR than their division, then they will skip division in their rank.  
I.E 1,500 MMR will give you Gold II, the moment you hit Honor Level 2.  
3,100 MMR will give you Gold I at HL 2, Diamond I at HL 3, and GM II at HL 4.  
C. This intentionally to make Ranking up a slow process to make sure your not put with players   
too far ahead or below, but not to make games slow to find: Yes, you could make a smurf   
account but do not forget the Honor System which actually has a meaning now, to slow down   
the process of smurfing since it cannot be stopped entirely.  
D. You will be able to find game easier by the system finding matches within a certain threshold   
of LP.  
E. Autofill will be an option that you can turn on or off, so you the player can choose if you want   
to have autofill to remove any excuses: If you were autofill then your MMR loss and gain will   
be decreased, if you were not autofill then your MMR loss and gain will be normal.  

3. Have LP actually reflect the amount of MMR you have.  
A. 400 MMR = 400 LP for Iron (You ranked up a division, from Iron I and on to Bronze VI)  
3,200 MMR = 400 LP for Grandmaster (You ranked up a division from GM I to Chal VI)  

4. Hit MMR and LP, for bad sportsmanship behavior  
A. If you dodge a game, then it counts as an automatic loss for you.  
B. If you dodge 3 games in a row and get de-ranked, lose 1 Honor Level.  
C. If your Honor Level does not match your rank, you will be de-ranked to match honor level.  
D. If you go AFK, it will count as a double loss for you.  
E. You get only 1 free dodge per week, because life happens: You should plane better.  

5. Report System - Create a new Tribunal  
A. A report will be sent against a player for Team Chat,   
if three or more players on the same team send a report for the same player,  
then the report will be processed and an outcome determined (punish or no).  
B. A report will be sent against a player for All Chat,  
if three or more players on the enemy team send a report for the same player,  
then the report will be processed and an outcome determined (punish or no).  
C. Let the team decide if their ally is toxic, then let the system give a verdict.  
Let the enemy decide if their ally is toxic, then let the system give a verdict.  
D. If you were successfully reported, you lose MMR: Yes that can affect your rank depending on   
your MMR and Honor Level.  
E. Enable voice chat all the time like Valorant, but make sure you cannot voice chat with the   
enemy team like Valorant: Valorant is just like League except First Person, this means   
teamwork is essential and it is a lot better to make the non-LCS closer to LCS for the sake of   
balancing patches and gameplay.  


Notes: I do not have a single idea how MMR works itself out, I simply know how MMR can make you speed up your Ranking process which needs to be removed to discourage smurf accounts and encourage accountability for a players action. I am keeping point number 1 and want it exactly the same. I am keeping point number 2 and I want to goal of having MMR be directly related to LP to be the same, however there are some improvements that need to figured out and so I look to you all to ad some ideas. I am Keeping point number three, however I am not sure if there is a better way to have MMR be reflected directly into LP and the Rank System. Point number 4 is definitely staying, if you think your a good player then you should be able to win no mater what: Once your find a game it is a battle to the finish only one team walks out and there is no dodging to get the easy way out, you make yourself and other players better by showing off how much better you are than everyone else but you do get one free excuse per week to get your life together. Point number 5 is definitely staying, but some adjustments may be needed: Keep in mind this considering the report system is worth a damn, which we all know it is not.

Ahri and I (Alistar Support) decide we don´t want to dodge, since we´d rather just play it out. 

&#x200B;

We get into the game: mid adc and jungle start saying we should open. They argue that game is lost since we had ahri top and jungler was autofilled. I say that's stupid, since we have already got into the game, we may as well at least play it out and try to win. 

Minute 15 arrives. We are somewhat down overall, but not that much. Still definitely winnable. My mid starts an ff vote. I vote no, so does top. My mid decides game is not worth playing anymore, despite being 2-1 and ahead in farm. Goes to the toplane and doesnt move from there ever again in the game

At the end of the game both my adc and my mid ask to get me reported for ""being cringe""

I guess wanting to play a game is cringe

&#x200B;

I really still don't get why dodging is still abusable, and I would really like Riot to do something about it 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I don't get why dodging games is still abusable and I'm tired of it being like that.",2021-04-30 08:22:35,0.0,n1i7a3

Now with Huya one of the biggest Chinese streaming platform having media rights over China LOL, they are allowed to make their own replays, highlights, promotional videos.

ddwnm,enorl76,"Case in point, a Garen building Stridebreaker, literally the only thing in the build that increases the AD, rest of build is Deadmans (no AD) Warmogs (no AD) Force of Nature (no AD) and still runs around at almost 500 movement speed destroying everybody but the tankiest tanks.

With virtually no damage items.

Besides the fact that movement speed items like this SHOULD NOT STACK, yet do, so you have ridiculousness like Garens or Darius or other ""immobile champs"" running around at breakneck speed, and yet these champs are balanced around BEING IMMOBILE.  They have insane damage budget because of the ""IMMOBILITY""

A Garen that builds full tank like this, should not have 16 kills at the end of the game.  He should have 16 assists.  He shouldnt have more than half the enemy teams kills.

There should be tank builds that make you TANKY but lack damage.  There should be viable DAMAGE builds that make tanks sacrifice their tankiness and become a bit squishy.

Right now tanks and similar have the best of pretty much all, tankiness, HP pool, movement speed, and damage to focus down somebody.  ""Oh we cant have only TANKY tanks... nobody would play them""  except THEY DO, BECAUSE THEY ARE TANKS... you are just projecting your opinion on the community",2021-04-30 16:23:54,0.0,n1pfy2

2znca35,LoLwolverene,"Despite the narrative that imports ruin the league and LCS would lose its fanbase without native players; what I've seen from viewership doesn't seem to support this. My numbers are from a random 3rd party site as well as ancedotal experience and I am not a data analyst, so I'm open to being incorrect at points. 



In LCS, the all-native teams were at the bottom of viewership, and those players were equally unpopular. Yes they were unpopular teams and new players who also did poorly, so it's somewhat expected. However even Dignitas which is a legacy NA team with players like Dardoch and Aphromoo, who also happened to do pretty well, still never beat out the top teams in viewership. My take has always been that NA fans are the same as pretty much every other sports fan in the world; they want to watch good teams and good players, and in general the teams that are consistently winning teams will have the most fans. TSM/TL/C9 can load their team with imports forever and likely never not be favorites as long as they keep winning. Players who are native to your region or have good branding/personalities will have an advantage, but in general people want to watch teams that win, especially in a scene where teams aren't backed geographically, as opposed to most US sports. This is admittedly an obvious conclusion, but it's contrary to the notion that NA can't survive without natives. 



Recently the first split of Proving Grounds just wrapped up. Amateur teams playing vs Academy, hosted on the LCS twitch/youtube channel, advertised on LCS twitter, LCS casters/analysts brought on for the finals. Pretty much everything NA fans have been asking for for years. The claimed solution to the entire region. Despite this, it averaged 10k viewers and peaked at 26k in the finals. Academy did similarly poorly; actually a decrease from previous years' viewership from what I can tell. To me this indicates that the concept of native talent is more of a niche interest; reddit and diehard fans may care about it a lot, but the average NA fan just doesn't care. 



I would say the real reason NA is losing viewership is the same reason that nearly all losing franchises lose viewership; eventually the ""we'll do better next year"" mentality runs out. The days of NA fans being able to say we're as good as EU or competitive with EU are mostly over, the hope that we'll be competitive internationally isn't there, and people simply don't want to want to watch the definitively worst region. How NA becomes good is an entirely seperate and very complicated topic, and many people believe the answer is native talent. This post is only in response to the concept that the import/native balance is the decider of viewership, whereas I would say it's more of an afterthought, and viewership will always mostly be decided by how good NA is. Curious if anyone with more expertise in viewership analysis has differing views.",2021-04-30 07:25:53,2.0,n1h5kw

I dont get it why Zhonya is still untouched for so many years, even dodged changes with item rework while many other items got dumpstered.

Still 120s CD on best active in the game, compared to 300s GA passive, STILL 2600 GOLD, compared to 3400 Mythics.

This item straight forward wins duels, teamfights and even whole games, removes assassins from the game and counters basicly everything.

Duskblade of Draktharr is not even close to Zhonya in terms of unhealthy gameplay, you need a kill with Duskblade to make use of it, while Zhonya can be used on demand to screw up everyones burst and deny any use of Duskblade.

Every AP champion is running with this item, no exception, and i even witnessed some tanks use it cause its just too damn good item.

I do own every skin in the game so this is only for that 1% of players..

But does anybody know if the Prestige Edition of Conqueror Jax IS re-rollable?

Since this skin cannot be bought and NO % of money goes to the worlds skin line or winning teams (DWG) I was wondering if we CAN re-roll this skin.

Its wierd to think that EVERY other prestige skin CAN be re-rolled exept this Jax one?

Also it doesnt make any sense to NOT include the normal Worlds skin for Jax BUT include his Prestige version in the hextech re-rolls??

ehj550j,Swyft135,"**Effect:** You start the game with one “Alchemist’s Ring” in your inventory, which can be sold for 50 gold. It initially provides no stats or effects. However, it can be fed gold to boost any stat you pick. Essentially, it is a fully-customizable stat stick.

**Details:** Owning this item grants you access to a special pop-up menu, where you can sacrifice 500 gold to the ring, up to 6 times, in exchange of the ring granting more stats. Each time you select the stat to be gained: AD, AP, armor, MR, HP, Mana, or attack speed. All stats are granted at 110% gold efficiency. Each stat can only be selected 4 times max. Once the ring has been fed at least 2000 gold (4 times), it begins to count as a legendary item. At any point, you can sell the ring for 50 gold + 50% of the gold it’s been fed.

**Analysis:** Purposed as a replacement for Omnistone, which no one really uses lol. The idea here is that this Keystone allows champions to create a custom item to fill in niches left unfilled by existing items – whether it’s lack of decent AD+MR items, or AP+HP+Mana items, or whatever. Ex. you can get AD 4 times and get MR 2 times, which gives you an item with (4 \* 500 gold \* 1.1 efficiency / 35 gold per AD) = 63 AD and (2 \* 500 gold \* 1.1 efficiency / 18 gold per MR) = 61 MR. You can also sell it for 50 gold, which grants you an early game advantage, at the cost of not having a keystone.",2021-05-02 23:41:47,2595.0,n3904g
2lv21r0q,Evelyn701,"One of Riot's stated goals in the item rework was to introduce more item diversity in the game. This is a very noble goal, and I think the Mythic Item system is an excellent opportunity to do this. But, Riot's *method* of achieving this is goal with Mythics has it backwards, in my opinion. More specifically:

**Mythic items should be *intentionally* non-diverse for each specific champion, and in return, almost all of the item diversity should come from Legendary items.**

Here's why:

**1. Mythic Passives**

Besides their sheer scale and cost, the most notable thing about Mythic items are the Mythic passives, which grant increasing amounts of stats the more Legendary items you get. I love this system, because while Riot isn't using it this way, it represents an *amazing* opportunity for Legendary item diversity. 

Many champions heavily rely on specific stats to operate. Assassins need their AD and Lethality, Battlemages need their HP and AP, Wardens need Resistances and AH, et cetera. This requirement means that buying items that *don't* give those stats in abundance is often self-sabotaging, and any deviations into other items have to be extremely well justified. 

You can likely see where I'm going with this. The very nature of Mythic passives is that, even when someone chooses to branch out into a weirder item, *they can still receive some of their vital stats*. Now if your Braum decides to buy into a Redemption for some extra utility, it won't feel like a waste of gold as long as he still gets some HP or Resistances from his Mythic. Diversifying your items won't be as punishing. 

**2. Kit Synergies**

When the rune rework came out long ago, many people had concerns that the specific keystone masteries would synergize to strongly with certain kits, locking some champions into certain runes while leaving others without any strong choices. This has proven, in part, to be true, although made better by practically every champion having at least one good choice. Basically every champion has 1 or 2 best choices for keystones, and that's satisfactory. 

The same is true of Mythics. Many synergize extremely well with a specific champion's kit, to the point where picking anything else is borderline trolling (try playing Samira without Shieldbow or Rek'sai without Prowler's/Stridebreaker. Or, better yet, don't).

Now, this doesn't need to be a bad thing, as long as this fact is *leaned into* rather than resisted. The very nature of ""very powerful, niche items"" means that most champions will have 1-2 optimal choices. This is fine, because again, in conjunction with Mythic passives, it means that *most champions can diversify their secondary items without gimping their whole kit.*

Which transitions into point number 3 - 

**3. Adaptation and Game Time**

Practically all instances of item diversity come in the form of adaptation, that is, adjusting which items you build based on your allies and enemies. It's how the recommended items work, how most build guides work, and is baked into the design of the items themselves. It can be as simple as building Armor against AD-focused teams, or as complex as buying Mobis instead of Lucis on Bard since you're behind in exp so it's better to give your ADC solo exp and get yours from Chimes. 

It's no secret that Mythic items were meant to be built first; I can count the number of champions that rush non-mythic Legendaries first on one hand. This, again, is not necessarily a a problem as long as it is leaned into. What I mean is that this formula meshes nicely with a key fact about item adaptation: *it becomes more valuable later in the game*.

This fact seems strange, but it's actually rather obvious when considered. It's better to build your resistances when you know which of the enemy champions will actually be a problem; better to know if you're gonna get a Cloud soul anyway before grabbing Chemtank; etc. Because the game state is usually more clear and set-in-stone late in the game, adaptation in builds becomes more possible. 

This means that Mythics are already almost always bought at *the worst possible time* to be adapting your build: right at the beginning of the game. If we simply assume that each champion will rush *their* Mythic (or, if not, another similarly powerful and kit-synergistic item like ER), and load more potential adaptability and diversity onto Legendaries bought later into the game, adaptation will become safer, more optimal, and more common. 

#TLDR: Because Mythics are by nature usually key to a champion's success, while Legendaries are more auxilliary items, making Legendary items more diversifiable will be vastly more successful than trying to force Mythics into diversity.

**EDIT:** I want to addend some clarification to this in response to the discussion. My point is that, ideally, Mythics represent items core to a champion's kit, and that those items that are vitally important to specific kits should be Mythics. For instance, Shieldbow with Samira, Nashor's with Azir and Diana, Liandry's with Brand and Teemo - these items just synergize so well with champion kits that we shouldn't bother making them diverse. 

There's two other kinds of items though - generalist items (Often stat-stick items), like Cosmic Drive or Warmog's Armor, and adaptive items, like Banshee's Veil or old Thornmail, that are built in response to specific champions, situations, and gamestates. Item diversity should come from *these* two categories of items, not from Mythics.",2021-05-03 14:24:45,158.0,n3pisw

bydn1,Razeerka,"This isn't a complaint so much as it is a lament. I actually don't dislike the 'new' Varus lore so much as I just really liked his old lore.

For those who don't remember or weren't around, Varus wasn't originally a Darkin possessing the bodies of two men. Instead he was more of a tragic hero. He started off as the guardian to a temple that contained a corrupted artifact (it's been awhile but I believe it was his bow and/or the corrupted tendrils in his ult). Whenever Noxus invaded his homeland he stood on guard to the temple, maintaining his duties as he watched his family and the rest of his village being slaughtered from afar. He eventually caved in and retrieves the corrupted artifact in order to use its power to kill the invaders, but at this point his village was already wiped out.

Aside from the lore itself, Varus's kit actually reflects his old lore much better than the current Darkin lore. The other two examples of Darkin (Rhaast and Aatrox) are much more healing focused in their kits. Also from an aesthetic standpoint Rhaast and Aatrox have similarities, but Varus does not share these similarities. Varus's voice lines also reflect the old lore still, with lines such as ""The guilty shall know agony"" and ""I'm on borrowed time"" reflecting that Varus more or less rejected his humanity in order to kill those who invaded his home.


There's not much of a point to this post, just wanted to look back on one of my favorite examples from the old lore. At least now we have champions who have a similar archetype in their lore, notably Pantheon who also relinquished his humanity to fight off a threat, although in his case it works out a lot better for him in the end.",2021-05-03 02:31:10,269.0,n3cmgz

I was playing an ultimate bravery build in norms when I alt-tabbed to check what I had to build next. When I went back to League this was what my screen looked like. I haven't been around for that long, but my friend told me this was 'the fuzz' and that he hasn't seen it in ages. It made for a fun gameplay experience.

The only way I could get rid of it was to use task manager to shut down League and then start it again. Though it was a ridiculous experience, it was pretty damn funny. Thank god it didn't happen in a serious game.",2021-05-03 10:30:11,22.0,n3lwbj

Hey there, I'm seeing a lot of posts here about complaints or rants of why isn't X or Y implemented yet in League, and I agree with almost all of them. So here I am making a list of nice things that'd be awesome if Riot implemented them in League.

Also, I hope this to be the last post of this kind in this sub, because I'm getting bored of seeing so many of them. Here we go:

\- Ability to play ALL champs in practice tool

\- Ability to switch between champs in practice tool instead of having to go back to lobby, and same for runes

\- Remove AFK from practice tool

\- Increase practice tool's 1 hour time limit

\- Make practice tool client sided so you can play it with no iternet, and 0 ping

\- Ability to try all skins (except unavalible ones) in-game before buying them, maybe in practice tool

\- Ability to place items on practice targets instead of just adding stats, or even adding champs as practice targets

\- Multiplayer practice tool

\- An actual tutorial for the game and not the BS we have

\- A combo practice mode where people upload ""replays"" of their combos and you have to imitate them

\- As well as we got the new shop with the ""recommended"" tab, made for each champion and taking into account enemy champions, we should have a recommended rune page based on our champ and enemy champs

\- Play the specific champion's theme at the beginning of the game, or at least part of it

\- A present for your birthday. Maybe some blue or orange essence, icon, chest or masterwork chest, hell even a gem or a skin shard

\- An Overwatch system like CSGO has, maybe avalible for Platinum and above

\- Achievements

\- Play a special music when you're at fountain and shopping

\- Voice chat. Now here I know that pings are more than enough to communicate, but an actual voice chat would be good, y'know, because this is a competitive game?

\- It is known that when you get a 10 or 25 chat restriction you only get your part of the chat, making you look out of context and bad. When someone gets reported for verbal abuse, both you and Riot should have acces to ALL chat, and not only your part of it

\- In replay mode, you should be able to watch your best and worst moments, just like in CSGO

\- Getting BE is pretty infuriatingly slow, there should be some more other ways to get BE. For example, if you buy starter series eternals for 2500 BE, and complete all the milestones, you should get your 2500 BE back and an extra 500. I say this since eternals are completely useless and most people only buy them for their main champions, like 3 or 4, and we also have to take OTP's into the formula. Killing 2 birds with one shot

\- Talking about eternals, since we are able to get series 1 eternals from capsules and buy them with barely 300 OE, we should be able buy them with OE at full price in the champ's page too, maybe 1050 OE 

This is all I can think of right now, and also took a look at old League posts in the sub. If I missed something or you'd like to add anything comment it and I'll add it in the post.

PD: I know there's rioters who unironically use reddit, so all I hope is for one of them to see this post and make our dreams come true.",2021-05-03 17:51:44,4.0,n3s9fx

They come back every single year and it makes no sense to make them only available for RP when they don't have anything extra or special compared to normal skin chromas.

And no, obviously legacy skins like Odyssey Ziggs shouldn't have their chromas available for blue essence at all since they aren't even available to purchase for RP but Halloween, Christmas and other holiday skins which return every year should definitely be available for Blue Essence.

They can make the Christmas and Halloween skin chromas available for blue essence in the annual Winter Blue Essence Emporiums (usually November - December) as it is also the time when those skins & chromas get reintroduced and removed from the shop.

I wanted to purchase Bewitching Elise is Your Shop so bad but then I realised that you can't buy any of the chromas for Blue Essence and therefore that's the only reason I'm hesitating to buy the skin.

awpagak9,stormiecx,"I have already covered many points as to why Aurelion Sol is simply not in a good spot right now in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ly0npv/aurelion_sol_the_forgotten_dragon/), but I feel as though it has not been given the attention it quite deserves. Thus I will elaborate in this post on specifically why Aurelion Sol simply is not at the level he needs to be as a midlaner, and specifically why he's not up to par by the standards of midlaners as of late by comparing his numbers as I did not do in my previous post.

For those of you who may not have read my post, the previous points I explored on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ly0npv/aurelion_sol_the_forgotten_dragon/) were:

1. His lack of kit direction. (Somewhere between a burst mage and a battle mage, but an awkward combination that leaves him feeling lackluster.)
2. His lack of decent itemization. (The removal or massive alterations of his core items like RoA and other tanky mage items without decent replacement.)
3. His lack of any balance changes in several years despite major alterations to the game (for example, the nerf of roaming midlaners with the introduction of turret plating and quicker midlane waves that punish him much harder for roaming.)
4. His clunky and weird kit that makes him completely different than any other champion as well as his higher skillcap mechanically, yet he does not provide anything better than any other midlaner that requires less of a skillcap to master.

Today, I will be discussing his numbers in comparison to other champions in the game. I have ran all of these champions under the same runes as to prevent the numbers from being unnecessarily altered, selecting only runes that would have no effect on the champion's damage output themselves.

&#x200B;

[Current screencap of Aurelion Sol's fandom wiki page.](https://preview.redd.it/mztt2tgdkvw61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0d4796ee387ffc0f741421634a629cf44850dab)

Quite frankly, his stats aren't good. He has the same amount of resistances as the average midlaner and slower than average movement speed despite his entire kit revolving around movement, not to mention the fact that he just overall has low damage early game (and even late game in comparison to some midlaners.)

But let me prove this with numbers instead of (assumed to be) known facts.

For the purposes of this, it is to be assumed that in each trial a full combo is one q, all of his W stars from a single W cast without moving to make them hit faster, one auto and his ult (if available).

In the case of a teamfight it is generally unlikely for Aurelion to hit every star, especially orbiting to make them hit faster and maximize damage. Thus, for the purposes of testing, I remained perfectly still to ensure the proper number of stars hit each time and triple-tested for accuracy. If your results vary, I did the combo as quicky as possible so Liandry's + Demonic procs may vary.

Full build is Liandry's + Sorc Boots + Rylais + Void + Demonic + Cosmic

&#x200B;

|Level (Points in each ability)|Items|Damage from full combo|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lvl 3 - 1/1/1/0|No items.|268 Damage.|
|Lvl 6 - 1/3/1/1|No items.|527 Damage.|
|Lvl 11- 3/5/1/2|No items.|930 Damage.|
|Lvl 16 - 5/5/3/3|No items.|1408 Damage.|
|Lvl 18 - 5/5/5/3|No items.|1528 Damage.|
|Lvl 6 - 1/3/1/1|Liandry's + Sorc Boots|900 Damage.|
|Lvl 11 - 3/5/1/2|Lia + Sorc + Rylai's|1633 Damage.|
|Lvl 18 - 5/5/5/3|Full build (See above)|2332 Damage.|

For the first test, I will be comparing him to Anivia. Anivia is a mage that has built similarly to Aurelion in the past, and who I consider to be a battle mage. (A mage reliant on consistent damage rather than burst damage.)

For Anivia, assume a full combo is Q + E + 1 Auto + 4 seconds of ult timed with in-game timer. I'm not perfect at timing as I am human, but I went with an average after 3 tries on each.

&#x200B;

|Level (Points in each ability)|Items|Damage from full combo|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lvl 3 - 1/1/1/0|No items.|283 Damage.|
|Lvl 6 - 1/1/3/1|No items.|691 Damage.|
|Lvl 11- 3/1/5/2|No items.|1140 Damage.|
|Lvl 16 - 5/3/5/3|No items.|1426 Damage.|
|Lvl 18 - 5/5/5/3|No items.|1434 Damage.|
|Lvl 6 - 1/1/3/1|Liandry's + Sorc Boots|1199 Damage.|
|Lvl 11 - 3/1/5/2|Lia + Sorc + Rylai's|1977 Damage.|
|Lvl 18 - 5/5/5/3|Full build (See above)|3128 Damage.|

&#x200B;

With just four seconds of her ult at full build, she nearly has 1,000 damage more than Aurelion Sol. Nevermind the fact that her abilities are easier to hit and more reliable than Aurelion.

Why is a champion considerably easier to play putting out more damage than he does, even if he perfectly hits everything?

In tests where I ran Anivia at level 6 with solely her Q+E + 1 Auto early game, she still nearly outdamages Aurelion Sol using his ult full combo without even so much as touching her own ult.

This just goes to show that, as a generally extended-trade based champion similarly to Anivia late-game, he has simply lackluster performance. Even using a suboptimal build for Anivia for consistency purposes, she still heavily outdamages him very easily.

Roaming midlaners are heavily nerfed as of right now, and if roaming utility is the goal then a champion like Twisted Fate simply outdoes him easily. Twisted Fate pre-level 6 does more damage in trades than Aurelion Sol and more reliably. Post level 6, he roams more efficiently and with less risk.

There is nothing that Aurelion Sol can do as a midlaner that other champions don't do infinitely better and more reliably.

He doesn't feel as though he has a single winning matchup in lane, especially due to the new assassin meta.

I have explained many times before how his winrate being decent right now is inflated due to people who one-trick him being really good at him, and explained this also in my previous post. If you need more additional information on this, I heavily suggest reading my previous post as I will not be elaborating this in the comments section.

The champion just quite frankly isn't in a good spot right now, and deserves to have at least some recognition due to the fact that he still has yet to receive a change in well over a year, and even then he has only received two changes since his failure of a mini rework back in season 9.

For those of you who have read this far, thank you very much for giving me your time. \^\^

If this post gets decent traction, I'll consider adding more champion comparisons in more detail like the one I did for Anivia.

But this is making the game boring in time. Once there was a 3v3 map , Twisted Treeline. For me , it was Hallowed Treeline. And it is an idea that can be applied to the map aswell. 3v3 competetive was so much fun then 5v5 competetive on Rift. Sure , there was big issues with Treeline but , with just a bunch of updates it could've get fixed , they dont rework a champion when it is not popular , they buff it or bring a skin to it. But for a map that is old as the game itself , they just removed it. And i still can't get over it because i was so obsessed with the map. 

If Riot ever brings back Treeline (which they should because this is the year of Shadow Isles and Treeline is in the Shadow Isles so bringing the map back with a polished version is the best idea imo) , they should rework the maps core idea.


Every tuesday i make a post about Treeline , and i will explain every rework idea in my mind for Treeline tomorrow , but for now what i have in mind is that making the map balanced for both teams. Because once you got behind in Treeline , there's no coming back from it.

8qifzwkt,Dubagshagur,"Hello, I used to play back in ~2013-16 &amp; took a few year break. Now that I started playing again I seem to get a lot of hate for not chasing after low health enemies. Lets say we have a 4v4 fight, 3 of the enemies die and one gets away with a few hp. Now all of the 3 of our team all run together after that low hp enemy. They chase them all across the map &amp; keep chasing even if they’re never gonna catch him. Meanwhile the enemy’s top is split pushing freely, I tend to stay behind and clear minions around the towers ( I’m usually adc/mid ). Now what happens 90% of the time is that the enemies all wake up &amp; come help out their teammate, killing all of our guys because they’ve all already wasted their abilities and summoner spells trying to catch the enemy escaping. Then they all blame and get mad at me for not going with them and not helping them. Am I wrong? I feel like I should only chase if I KNOW for sure we’re going to get that kill, and even then 2v1 should be enough, no need for the entire team to go. Or when its just me (a squishy champ) & Yasuo alive, Yasuo jumps into 5v2 under their tower and dies, blames me for not going in with him. Of course I’ll try to help but that would just be two dead instead of one. A lot of the times this is happening the top split pusher gets the tower because there is no one there to defend it. I feel like its a lot smarter for me to just let it go and stay behind, farm and defend the towers instead. But then again I’ve watched a lot of videos saying that adcs should engage in any team fight possible and help out the team, but whats the point of wasting time if I know we’re not going to catch him? I’m a very pushy player and love to harass enemies but to me farm is more important than chasing someone down the entire map. I’ve noticed players these days are alot crazier about kills than they used to, I see a lot of tower diving and stupid shit done for kills, but maybe thats just a low elo thing? Anyways the next time I play should I just run along with the team or should I stay back and defend &amp; farm? Thank you!",2021-05-03 19:21:55,1.0,n3tln8

The CDR-Hability Haste was a pointless change, I just have to always check the conversion to see if I'm at 40 or 45% CDR, I don't think AH is intuitive at all.

The recommended shop changes are actually good.

Item's aesthetics are garbage, most of the items that existed before this season just look far worse on S11, maybe Rabadons and Morello look better now? But the rest of them Jesús christ, corrupting potion, dorans blade, Essence Reaver, it still looks like a mobile game and the old models were much cleaner, I wish there was a feature to change them.

4l5pg23o,ZahaviForPresident,"I created a 12 team World Cup tournament to see how competitive teams would be if players could only play for their country. The results were surprising.

[World Cup Teams](https://preview.redd.it/fpjt7adn3mw61.png?width=2774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8baa56d6815a69c7d9b9211cfc054562c554816c)

*Non-first division teams are labeled in red.*

Before continuing, please note that this is just a first draft at what the teams might look like. Of course, the coaches of these respective countries would know better than me as to how to structure and draft their lineups to bring to an international stage.

Now, the first two things that initially shocked me were:

1. \*\*Denmark is extremely strong.\*\*This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who knows about [Denmark's eSports infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8RDGWgW4ZA&t=557s), but it is definitely still surprising to see that this team might even be a favorite to win the whole tournament.
2. \*\*Most teams had fully professional rosters.\*\*When I was first building this list I suspected that I would have to pull many players from Academy or EU Masters to fill out the European rosters, however, in the end only **5** academy/masters players were called up to start for their country.

In the past, we have seen teams swap in and out players from their bench to great success. In 2015 SKT would [swap between Faker and Easyhoon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FzESh2uzdY) And in 2018, FNC [swapped out sOAZ for Bwipo,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IITWE1OskM) and eventually reached the finals. In this tournament, the amount of star power on the benches of some of these teams means that we could see completely new strategies develop around player swapping just to utilize the full potential of these rosters.

Other eSports leagues have already produced international tournaments, one of the most famous being the [Overwatch World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_World_Cup). South Korea has won 3 titles (as expected), but in 2019, South Korea didn't even make the finals, and instead USA beat China 3-0. So even though the LoL bracket seems stacked in the favor of South Korea (as it always does), you never know what could happen.

My top 4 global power rankings based on this line up would be

1. South Korea
2. China
3. Denmark
4. Germany

with dark horses Taiwan and Sweden

If anyone with more knowledge than me could come up with a full global power rankings list please do so and I'll edit this post.

EDIT:

A lot of people seem to think MSI is just KR, CN, EU and NA. If you look at the whole MSI bracket you will see that the bottom 7 teams are *much* worse than any team in the World Cup Tournament. Thats why I wrote that this tournament is much more competitive than MSI.

EDIT 2:

If this tournament reached relative importance equivalent to something like the FIFA World Cup then it would be a valid reason to maintain import rules in major regions. As of right now, there is not really any practical incentive. ",2021-05-02 19:19:26,61.0,n34b2u

v7mdl,Gebrasy,"Good day, I remembered that I did such a post for the last EU Masters that we've had, so I thought that I would look at what happened this year and compare the major differences from the last EU Masters tournament. The nationalities of the EU Masters quarterfinalists are:

6 - Polish. 
5 - French. 
4 - German, Dutch. 
3 - Danish, Bulgarian. 
2 - Portuguese, British, Norwegian. 
1 - Austrian, Italian, Serbian, Greek, Spanish, Czech, Belarusian, Belgian, Romanian. 

There are 18 different nationalities represented in this edition, whilst last year only 15 different nationalities were represented in the quarterfinals.

The leading country is yet again Poland, but this year they only qualified 6 players compared to 10 last time. French, German, Dutch and Danish amount of representatives hasn't changed much, but Sweden got blasted, because they haven't qualified anyone, compared to 5 last time.

European countries by POP to not have a single player in the quarterfinals:

1. Russia.
2. Ukraine.
3. Sweden.
4. Hungary.
5. Switzerland.

Yet again the Baltics bomb out, the Balkans did slightly better than usual, although they still lack representatives from countries like Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia, Moldova, Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro etc. It is also interesting that Spain have such a huge scene, but there's only a single Spanish player in the top 40 yet again.

&#x200B;

Because Gwen is melee, **IN GENERAL**, if she is damaging you, you can damage her back. Or take a small step to be able to. And while yes, she can move it once, it automatically does so when she leaves, meaning she can't move too far away from her initial cast location and still gain the benefits.

It only protects her, unlike something like Windwall.

It has a 27 cooldown at rank 1, and because it is ALWAYS maxed last, that cooldown isn't moving till level 14. While Gwen often picked up a bit of ability haste, 20 seconds is still a super long cooldown. Don't fight when her ""op counterplayless"" ability is literally active.

&#x200B;

The only thing I can't argue is great is the extra resistance scaling with AP. Bonus defensive stats scaling with offensive power is not a good thing ever. But that is not the flashy thing people notice about this ability.",2021-05-03 08:09:35,7.0,n3jg90
7vko5ut4,StepOnMeB-Sha,"Poppy's passive range scales with crit chance, increasing the range by 125 at 100% crit chance.( This would make the range 600 on her passive. )

Lulu's passive gains 2% bonus AD scaling (for a total of 6% bonus AD per attack), making it a little more effective when going AD Lulu as opposed to on-hit AP Lulu.

Annie's Tibbers gains 50% of Annie's bonus attack speed, tripled (150% bonus attack speed) and uncapped when Enraged. This is a small nudge to attack speed Annie- which no-one does since most of her stats are atrocious for a marksman.

Janna's W gains on-hit effects. This would be the final push to get people to play Janna in other roles besides support- as Lich Bane would become her pure power item.

Zed's passive gains 5% maximum health per 100 AP scaling. It would remain untouched by a lot of people, but some dedicated enough might try to see if they can Ult > Lich Bane > Passive > Echo Damage one-shot- and would make for some cool plays if possible.

Xayah's W gains 10% per 100 AP bonus attack speed. Xayah is a champion locked to crit ever since the rageblade fix, but it could be interesting to see how Xayah could support Rakan instead- people would poke around with this one.

Lee Sin's R gains 135% AP scaling. (AP) Lee Sin support has been played a few times over, with AD Lee Sin support being the more dominant one. It would be amazing to have people try to work around enough kinks to get a one (punch?) hit on their R and make AP Lee Sin into another option.

All AD portions of Akali's kit are changed to physical damage. Akali's whole slick before her rework was to be a dual damage assassin, and with the last change removing the AD portion of her ult, none of her abilities do physical damage anymore. Seeing how successfully Katarina adapted to being able to deal physical damage with her ultimate, besides her on-hit effects- it really couldn't hurt to give Akali the choice of having magical base damage with physical damage scaling. Likewise, this means making all scaling into bonus AD scaling so AP Akali does not benefit from potential AD Akali scaling buffs.

Talyah's W gains a 275% bonus attack damage scaling. Thresh kinds of things. A ridiculous scaling calls for a ridiculous build.  


Edit: This is just a few ideas. I think the most important thing to say here is that having options is nice. One type scaling champions are very linear in playstyle, especially once you've played them for a while and really want another way to play them. A really great change I saw riot do was making Annie's E into an actual shield- which got a few Annie mains to not feel locked to midlane anymore.",2021-05-02 16:30:22,88.0,n325yq

Every time a jungle main suggests changes, all it generates is reddit community's aggression. Fun fact:  fighting is fun and MOBAs aren't really meant to be 1v1 / 2v2 simulators, so adding a role that can start fights and impact the map early on is healthy.

At the same time, I would suggest learning basic jungle pathing instead of complaining about the role on the forum when it kills you at predictable times. Here's a simple, 10 minute guide to help you track enemy jungler and reduce your deaths to ganks.

And to answer immediate response ""gotchas""

- Not enough data


This latest data is over 2/3 days yes, however I have monitored this over the last month with people making daily reddit cry threads and the percent never change much more than 0.2-0.3%. Also I cba to write out an intro stats lesson for you on statistically significant results but sample sizes like this are more than fine to draw results from. 

It rarely changes much from those % recently.

- This is just mained roles, not necessity including secondary roles

Anything else on secondary roles is going to mostly anecdotal, and you cannot say more people don't actually have jungle 2nd. Most likely second role follows extremely closely correlated to mained role as most popular.

- But I played fill or got autofilled to jungle instead of support

Very cool thanks for the contribution, this is an anecdote and not useful data however.

- This is just for plat+ all regions!

2un2zmoo,981854aB,"Something that I have never understood is why tanks do so much damage. I simply find it to be unhealthy for the state of the game. Maokai is a perfect example. Maokai is my oldest main/1-trick, he has sustain (mana troubles early game though), hard cc in 3 abilities of his kit, and late game will become useful tank. However, he does an unnecessary amount of damage, I can't be bothered to pull up the actual numbers but it's insane. I hit level 6 and am literally 100-0'ing my lane opponents with 0 bonus AP (I do have bami's but you get the point). Take Volibear for example, he does the damage of a bruiser but is built full tank, I just don't understand that. I don't understand how it's balanced, I feel like it wouldn't be an issue if you would keep the tankiness, keep the cc, but get rid of the insane damage.",2021-05-03 14:14:27,0.0,n3pdpz

It is a high pressure situation, people go wild sometimes. I get it. BUT after that I did a few normal games and believe or not, all of these game were even more unfun than playing ranked. People went crazy about others going 0/8, flaming, pinging and raging like hell. Ofc some people are just a\*\*holes, even in normal games, I mean what the hell some people even flame in aram or in rotating game modes, but I felt something was different today. Everyone was so unchill that I thought to myself where are all the fun people at? Are most League player that unpleasant to play with in todays time and age?

cvk40qp,TechnicallyAWaffle,"**Changes:**

Glacial Augment's slow for both ranged and melee is changed to be a flat 70 - 90 slow for melee and 50 - 70 for ranged, ramping up over 1.5 seconds. This slow stacks onto other existing slows, with percentage based slows being calculated **before** Glacial Augment's is applied.

Freeze Ray changed to fire a non-projectile ray at the target, causing them to leave behind a trail for 450 units that slows enemies by 25%. The trail dissipates instantly along with the slow effect once the target has travelled 450 units, or after 5 seconds (whichever comes first). If the target is an enemy, they are also slowed by the same amount. This slow stacks additively onto other existing slows.

Freeze ray now procs on ALL item actives that damage or debuff enemies. Empowering, healing, or shielding an ally shoots a freeze ray at them.

&#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

Opens up the rune to anyone who uses item actives as part of their kit, and the exception of Glacial Augment breaking the rules of slows in League makes it viable as a form of extra CC on champions that already have slows, or provides great utility for those who have item actives.

Changing glacial augment's slow to a flat amount makes it less oppressive late game, where I feel like the rune would really start to shine with the crazy amounts of item actives and CC that can be chained into astronomical slows. Having a flat slow that stacks onto existing ones lets the rune still shine and be beneficial without providing too much utility.

Changing Freeze Ray was mainly to make it so that it could be used with supportive items like Locket and Redemption to offer allies some extra self peel. The unique effect of having the trail last for a certain amount of units also makes it so that you can't funnel hyper-mobile carries to zoom across the map with an ice trail. It also forces enemies to move and create an ice trail, or suffer a 30% slow for the full duration of 5 seconds.

Inspiration is all about breaking and bending rules, and I think these changes fit this rune perfectly in terms of that identity. Being the sole exception to the universal rule that slows cannot stack, this rune can become much more versatile and play on existing strengths or patch up weaknesses like other runes should.

Is it OP? Maybe. I put lots of thought into trying to tweak this rune and make sure that no scenario comes out on top as a new broken pick. With so many champions though, I'm sure there's bound to be a broken pick or few so please tell me in the comments.",2021-05-03 03:36:57,7.0,n3e2g8

What I didn’t realize is that the internet started to turn off at a given time and before I learned to play my games around this, I was getting lots of low prio queue times for leaving. 

I understand that this was not okay of me and I was ignorant about the situation, but I have been a lot better at getting off before the internet goes off, and I haven’t left a game in months now. Fast forward to today, my power goes out in my house and it takes about 5 minutes to get it back on idk what happened but it did. I got back to the game, and it was like I never left, we ended up winning, no one was butthurt from my temporary dc and thay understood.

c3g94,Gregersen12,"Maybe I've just been unlucky, but over the weekend (playing Friday, a little bit Saturday and then a bit again Sunday), I don't believe I had a single game without some player being autofill. This was across ranked flex, and solo queue across 2 accounts in low and high diamond respectively.

I know queues are supposed to be a bit longer to find the right amount of players, as the player base is a bit narrower at this level, but I genuinely had at least one autofilled player every single lobby.

I think the autofill is a decent system. Personally I'd rather have it be opt-in and let queues be longer and get my preferred role with others having it too. But it's a nice enough middleground. Anyways, I thought having *at least* one every game seem a bit excessive.

I'm suspecting the latest patch may have to do with it, but I didn't get a chance to play on the weekdays, while the patch was out, so could also be the holidays/weekend.

Was this just my experience, or has anyone else noticed this too?

Every season I tell myself ""this is going to be it!"" (In short it never really is). I've paid for coaching by Challenger players and talked to a lot of my high elo friends on tips and advice. I don't play every game perfect nor do I win every single lane or hard stomp it. My general mindset is ""end the game asap"" and ""if I can't win lane go even, or get someone else fed"". I have the courtesy to understand that losing isn't fun and that I don't want my team to suffer for my mistakes. What I've noticed is that there seem to be a lot of people playing ranks just for the hell of it and don't take it seriously. Is there a way for riot to enforce better competitiveness to the game. I just had an ap j4 support who blamed us for the loss. A couple games back I had a jungler who just refused to get drake because ""they didn't feel like it"". It was no big deal cause we had mid and bot prio. I don't want this to come off as a rant, I'm genuinely curious if other people feel the same way as me. I don't mind if i go on a 30 game loss streak, as long as every game seemed fair and everyone was competitive and tried their best.

9s6nq41e,Sakaita,"Wild rift brought back many of the community's loved and hated items while also bring in some new items or even changing preexisting ones. For example ultimate hunter is now a mage item that builds out of a Lost Chapter. One of those items or runes they brought back is Kleptomancy. Now kleptomamcy had to be removed as it gave farm heavy hyper-carries like Ezreal and Kayle way to much gold that help them scale way to safely and well. It also was just very niche, even more than omnivore is now (as literally no one uses it).

Kletomamcy was changed into something more of like a Zoe W where every 25 seconds upon hitting a champion with either a ability or auto attack you get a random item effect, and on the next attack it will proc.

This rune altho not strong at first glance it can give you some pretty good advantages once you see which one you have gotten, there for taking advantage of this new strength and using it. You can go for a risky trade thanks to it procing redemption meaning you can heal some hp back up if it goes wrong  or go for a quick dive know you proced locket. It gives both offensive and defensive playstyles to all champs that use it (I pretty much use it on everyone but I'm insane so meh).

While It may not be as strong as other runes it sure as hell can be more useful than others, just imagine a seraphone with this rune being able to proc remption and then 25 seconds later a locket for her whole team. That added utility really can't be gained from any other rune. It also rewards aggressive  playstyles like for example a syndra with ludens can proc it once then klepto can give you another free ludens proc instantly for some very hard pokeage which then leads to another ludens proc from your item as it has prob already been 10 seconds. 

There are many situations where this rune can be very useful to you. This rune is balanced by its decent cooldown, but I'd say it is much more impactful than omnistone which warrants it a longer cooldown (maybe 30 seconds instead). It can also be strapped to a algorithm so that for example: you get righteous glory movement speed when chasing someone or locket when you take some burst.

You don't need to remove omnistone as other rune pages have 4 runes so omnistone users can still enjoy that thing while being unaffected by this rune. 

There are some champs in the specialist role that can't really benefit from any rune, and while Kleptomancy might not be the greatest fit for them it can definitely give them the edge they need in certain situations that omnistome couldn't. It can also open up diffrent possibilities for other champs like Oriana going into a more support like playstyle with this rune or even open up champs like teemo, sett, or even jhin into diffrent roles.

Let me know what you think as with wild rift being out it has been so much fun play it especially with omnistone on a lot of drifrrent champs.",2021-05-03 10:48:00,0.0,n3m70o
7qs0qq79,your_nude_peach,"Hello lil fellas and toxic haters. I just want to figure it out why the people are so toxic? I was in very bad games and situations a billion of times but staying cool, chill, clever let us win those games. On the other hand games where people  just want to flame and blame everyone used to end up very unhappy. Im glad to win but I'm also glad to loose if it worth the experience and was just an interesting game.


But even in fun mode games people are so toxic. For example, yesterday when i got home after almost a year away I just wanted to play some PC league to see what's new, try one for all mode after so many years. Bad things started there... I wasn't able to join the queue for almost 15 mins. People just declining matches lmao. And it was straight for almost 15 mins geez. After time passed I finally got into the champion selection/ban phase. And know what? If I understand the logics of the people right: if you ban their champion they leave, if they don't get the champion they want even if it's not banned, they leave, if the pick is a trash champ such as Zyra, Seraphine or something else, they leave. Guess how long it took for me to play at least one and first game on this bad evening? 1 hour 25 minutes. I wasn't able to start the match for an hour and a half... It was really weird and frustrating, but I was watching anime so it wasn't really a bad burden, thanks to the modern technologies. 


Anyway, finally, the game started. We got Zyra against Blitz. Before minions were spawned oir premade top lane gave them double kill. Our premade bot lane started to flame. And everyone were blaming me because I was the one who pickee Zyra lmao. Actually Zyra was the random pick I just didn't care. And Imo Zyra is a very good champion. But still those guys got hooked and continued to feed them. The game was very long though but after 30 minutes top premade just stayed on base and shitted me and how bad is Zyra. I did not the best job but I was killed 3 times and killed over 13 times while those guys in my team managed to die 10+ times each and made like 3-5 kills.... and bot lane were playing 2v1 while I was playing mid lane vs 2 blitz and died only 1 time during lane phase when 3 of them dived me under the tower
I was really sad how it all was going on and we just decided to surrender.

In my opinion it was a fun game even against Blitz. Dodging their hooks and juking them was very amusing. But when you get cought - youre dead in 0.3 seconds lmao

With my idea, the cool original keystone idea is kept intact (maybe some balancing needs to be done, since there'd be a new feature of course), but it's a better addition to the ""rule bending"" inspiration tree and would allow for a lot of innovation!

l2jbb,Random_Nom,"Twitch joined the League of Legends on May 1st, 2009. Today officially marks Twitch's 12th year as a playable character in the game! I wanted to celebrate by drawing something for him. Twitch has been a big part of my life for a long time, he's a really fun and interesting character in so many ways—from gameplay to character design, there's so much to love about him as a character. I know he can be frustrating to deal with in game, but I think he's one of the more fun and expressive characters in the game; a big part of Twitch's gameplay is being able to use his stealth to take risks and position in places most normal champions wouldn't be able to. Overall, he's a great character and one of the things that keeps me coming back to League of Legends, and I'm proud to have experienced so many years playing the Plague Rat.

Graphs made using NA server op.gg data from April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2021.

&nbsp;

Nothing super exciting, but here are a few observations:

1. Master tier is huge now. Last year less than 200 players were master; this year there are over 1700.

2. Iron tier has been squished back down to be the bottom 2.5% rather than the bottom 8% that it was last year.

3. Diamond 4 is a lot smaller and more in line with the other diamond divisions.

4. Divisions 1 of every tier minus bronze and iron are bigger than they were last year.

5. Gold and below tiers are lower on the ladder and more resemble the season 9 ladder (from April 30, 2019).

2b4ypjje,oliverschneck,"As we quickly approach MSI 2021 in Iceland, I thought it would be good to look back at NA’s previous performance at MSI. Although TL’s dominance in the LCS feels like ages ago, they were the last team from NA to perform at an MSI. Many like to think that C9’s run at 2018 worlds and defeating AF in the quarterfinals was NA’s best performance internationally, but TL’s 3-1 win against IG in MSI 2019 semis was far more impressive IMO. For context, IG was coming off of a world championship, a strong spring split in the LPL, and a record breaking 9-1 performance in the MSI group stage. TL’s performance is usually overshadowed by their laughable loss in the finals (which was quite entertaining) but their win against IG shouldn’t be understated. Hopefully C9 can bring their A game and one up TL’s 2019 MSI run

1wvuapqq,thesilentdude42,"Almost a year ago when Voyboy made his famous stairs video Riot decided to take crucial steps in order to fix the issues which the entirety of League's community is frustrated about and required everybody to agree to the rules of soloQ (basically you had to confirm that you will try your best to win and also not be toxic).

I really can't speak for all of you guys but for me the experience is no different to what it used to be and I'm on the very edge of losing my mind because of those 'GUARDIANS OF THE SOLOQ' type of players who mid game decide that 'yeah this botlane doesn't deserve the win' and stop even trying to play League with their team and start to soft int even though the game's going pretty good :))))))

I'm sure it has happened to you many times as well as many other soloQ specials such as people being unable to handle the fact that they simply can't expect everybody to play according to their plan and also people not playing perfectly. Many of those situations nowadays don't lead to a player being AFK but going to a sidelane and spending there the rest of the game constantly pushing the lane with no vision, dying to enemies and typing these idiotic things such as 'ayyy that was so close' or 'oh he is so good' or 'i'll get him next time haha!'.

Sure it counts as a win, but I'd rather play the game out as there aren't that many clash tournaments and it'd feel a lot better if the win we got was deserved. 

The answer doesn't have to be punishments imo, it could be just incentivizing playing, maybe buff the rewards a bit (I'd buff them in general they're pretty bad) but especially for people who lose one.

He made these really trashy short satirical ""guides"" for champions like Jarvan IV, Nasus, Draven and Darius. He always used this one popular TTS voice that was *MLG* back then ([https://ttsdemo.com/](https://ttsdemo.com/) Daniel voice) .  
I distinctly remember the Darius guide, as he picked up the common dunkmaster theme (space jam music), and the Draven guide, which had something to do with buying Phantom Dancers. I cannot remember his name, and after searching with several different filtering tools, I could not find his content, so I assume he deleted his channel long ago.

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"My guess for why around this this is simply:

As in the reason why flex picks where a Champ is viable in 3 or more roles is unhealthy (At least for Pro Play) because it takes away the draft picking potential selecting champs have if you could just pick the same champ for that many roles, making it harder for the other team to counter said picks and making the ban phase/pick phase hard to do without having to worry about a pick that would still mean doom for their comp simply because they are in another role.

I think that is the main reason, but I am not to sure.

You can just ignore the reasoning I am guessing on and just answer if you feel like it.

Great song used for game 5's but I think we can all agree not every game 5 is the same. Some hold more value than others. This last LCS final was an enjoyable series. I actually enjoyed it. Then when Silver Scrapes played I lost my shxt. 

I remembered

 **I haven't enjoyed watching NA LCS in quite some time.**   


I propose LCS production let the fans decide if silver scrape should be played for a series or not.  


or 

Only when it fits these criteria:

the series is a back and forth affair 

the favourite to win stomps and the underdog starts clawing their way back into the game 

game 4 had some wicked sick team fights

some next level/ never before seen stuff like when peke backdoor'd  SK stepmom

9w96rd5,AlFasGD,"Scoring takedowns permanently grants you the slain champion's keystone at reduced power. Successive takedowns on the same champion rewards further reduced power of the same keystone. Multiple keystones function together. Slaying multiple champions with the same keystone does not apply the power reduction rule, and bonuses stack additively.

Against champions with Stakeholder, the granted effect instead is a 12.5% bonus power of the already rewarded keystones. Multiple Stakeholder bonuses stack additively, successive kills against the same champion offer reduced bonuses according to the rules below.

Works with all keystones, as their effects are independent.

""Power"" refers to every number that isn't related to time, meaning that it has no effect on the keystone's cooldown or duration times.

Minor notes:
- Getting Predator enables the Predator effect on boots.
- Cannot get Unsealed Spellbook because of the steep powerspike and no scaling upon being rewarded.

# Numbers

Each takedown rewards the keystone with the given power multiplier: 0.15 × 0.6^t, where t is the times that the same champion had been slain before. In other words, this results in the following sequence:
- 15%
- 9% (24% total)
- 5.4% (29.4% total)
- 3.24% (32.64% total)
- 1.944% (34.584% total)
- ...

This sequence converges to 37.5% of total power of one champion's keystone, in which case the best case scenario yields a total power of 187.5% power from keystones of enemy champions.

# Examples

Against 1 Stakeholder and 4 other keystones

Total other keystone power converges to 150%, while Stakeholder bonus converges to 12.5% × (37.5% / 15%) = 2.5 × 12.5% = 31.25% bonus. As a result, the total keystone power converges to 150% × 131.25% = 196.875%.

Against 2 Stakeholder and 3 other keystones

- Other keystone power converges to 112.5%.
- Stakeholder bonus converges to 31.25% × 2 = 62.5%.
- Total power converges to 182.8125%.

Notice how the keystone's power bonus immediately falls off against multiple Stakeholder users (which holds true for the current numbers which are obviously subject to change, assuming this idea even goes through).

# Observations

This keystone offers a great solution for those that look to snowball, champions that can make use of multiple keystones, or against champions that you'd expect have the same keystone. It definitely doesn't stand as a go-to keystone for every champion out there, along with the fact that they're also forced to use the rest of the Inspiration tree instead of the typical tree they would benefit most off of.

# Conclusion

I believe this idea would be a great replacement for Prototype: Omnistone, while still messing with the general idea of keystone blending, without disabling other options.",2021-05-03 06:09:19,3.0,n3h92r

3q5wbf7c,IOnlyReadMemesSry,"So as we all know, couple years ago Riot games decided that it’d be nice if we get exclusive skins that are only obtainable through hard grind and time, or by draining your already empty wallets even more. 

First, these skins lacked in quality, but at least not quantity. There were about 4 released each year, with a “fixed” pattern which Riot has followed until this point.

As time went on, sure their quality got way better. Just compare Jarvan and Swain- who I think is exceptional in that it somewhat fixed the problems that people had with gemstone skins- it was very unique and high quality, and even tho the emotes weren’t something new, the extra touch of the gemstones in them made the skin feel a bit more exclusive and worthy of spending your hard earned / purchased gemstones on.

But I digress, of course skin quality should improve over time. Now here is the problem.

A gemstone skin should’ve already been released by now this time of the year, and there is nothing to be heard of a new one which is to be expected as they are usually not leaked. But here is the thing. I generally think Riot games has came to the conclusion that there is no point in releasing these skins anymore. 

People are way more excited about their “new” Prestige skins, which not only require EVERYONE to spend their money on ( the Passes ) but that they also grind a decent amount during this time which of course is also valuable to Riot games, since not only do you keep the game alive, but the more you play the more you will be drawn to spend money on your favorite champion(s). Whereas with gemstone skins, there is 3 types of people compared to the 2 with prestige skins.

With prestige, you either have all skins and can just reroll the newest prestige, or don’t. Now if you have all skins basically, Riot “doesn’t really care about you”. You have already spend thousands and will probably, their main focus is not to encourage those people to spend even more as they do it on their own. On the other hand, the “average” player has to buy and grind the pass no matter what, which is 99% of all people who want these skins. And a lot of people do. 15$ and a bit of grind doesn’t sound too bad for an “exclusive” shiny skins which they can flex with.

But with the introduction of these passes, and the lack in release of gemstone skins, they got much more obtainable than they were before. Again, we have the type of people who probably have 100+ gemstones stacked up- Riot doesn’t care. There are the veteran F2P players, who have couple gemstones saved up, so in case a new skin gets released they can just buy it. Or, the people who spend money here and there on the game, but probably have 10+ gemstones saved up already from all the ways you can acquire them. So the only people that Riot can really get money from for these Gemstone skins are the newbies, who are willing to spend. But realistically, they won’t dish out 100$+ immediately for 1 skin, so that’s a no from Riot again.

It is clear that Gemstone skins have failed and Riot sees no opportunity in them because they don’t make nearly as much money as some of the very popular skins lines like Project, Star Guardian- or their new golden goose; the Prestige Skins.  I just begin to wonder why is this not addressed already with the intention of “reworking” these passes. They are a company, it makes sense they want to produce the things which make them the most amount of money- but why not just incorporate these Gemstone skins into a new method which would revive people’s interest in them?

I know this is a mouthful, curious to see what you think if you have read through this whole essay lol. It has just been really been bothering me recently, so I thought I’d get your guys’ opinion on this topic.",2021-05-02 19:08:10,8.0,n345fr

None of these champions have a higher than 53% win rate at most elos; however all of them have pick rates and ban rates that when added go over 25%.

The state of this game's balance would be much better if we simply realised that having more than 25% presence almost always means a champion is broken.

Right now these champions are protected from nerfs, despite dominating solo queue, simply because we have tons of criterea available and truly just look at one (win rate).",2021-05-03 12:31:22,0.0,n3nvza

t2q65,moal09,"From MegaT145:

>There could be a debuff applied that mimics older changes. For example, it could apply “Cry of the Damned”, which could be as follows: “Enemy takes x% increased damage from pets while inside the wall; this effect lasts for 3s after they leave the wall.”  It would encourage strategic wall placement in lanes. The % damage could also scale with points in W, capping at 50%. This actually rewards maxing it after 3 Q points.

Obviously, the numbers could be tweaked, but this would offer Yorick players some kind of benefit for landing their W on champions who can otherwise instantly jump out of it + anyone with Stridebreaker (the walls are coded as minions and not terrain, so lots of stuff can go over it like Garen's Q), etc.

This would also make him a lot more interesting mechanically, since wall placement would become a bigger part of his gameplan.

Wouldn't necessarily have to be a damage buff either.  Could be something like a slow that applies for a second after they leave the wall.  Would help quite a bit with some of his really hard counter match-ups and make him more impactful in team fights without making him ridiculous like the ghoul burst buff did.",2021-05-03 04:46:36,1.0,n3fjv0

Over time, I've learned to poke decently during laning phase and not cast abilities on minions. However, every time an enemy champ attacks me and I get low, I just get too passive. Like I'd shield my ADC if possible but just focus too much on fleeing afterwards, sometimes even forgetting that my R was ready. This would more often than not leave my ADC / teammates to die

I've been flamed a few times for this with other people question pinging me or straight up telling me to stop playing support. The thing is, as much as I wanted to help sometimes, I don't want to just feed the enemy team provided how easy to kill I usually am

Ranked fucking sucks...

The sheer amount of trolls I ran into was pure insanity.

I've never seen this level of blatant greifing.

Ap riven top. Teemo screaming and crying in all chat since minute 2.

Tryndamere adc, Ap twitch (I don't care that's stupid)

There's still the inting top laners which is the ONLY reason I won my gold and plat promo's.

I've dodged more queues in this month that I have in my entire league career. I've probably lost close to 500lp and 6 hours of just sitting in low priority que for dodging than I've actually played games. Because we've gotta maintain that 50% WR. Then for some reason roughly half of my games result in a 20 minute surrender. Either when we're ahead and some chad dickfart tried to 1v5 and then gave up. Or the enemies run it down and I know they're all flaming.

It took all my willpower to not tilt off the face of the earth and now I'd addicted to Benadryl.

1416iiec,linhwinn,"There are simply no good clash finder apps out there. Play.op.gg was a thing but they stopped it for some reason. I wanted a clash finder that is automatic. Meaning, you should only have to type in your summoner name to recruit or find teammates; no account creation and no manual team creation. Check out the app I made here: [https://asobi.gg/clash](https://asobi.gg/clash).

**If you are looking for a team to play with:** 

All you have to do is type in your summoner name, and Asobi will show you all of the teams looking to fill up their roster. You will be able to see everything you need: team name, team tier, team members, how many people they are looking for, and what roles they are looking for. You will be able to see each team member’s basic stats, but if you want to see more detailed stats, you can click on their name and it will take you to their opgg. To interact with the team, just comment on their post.

**If you are a team looking to recruit teammates:** 

If you haven’t done so, create your team in the League of Legends client first, then hop to Asobi and type in your summoner name. We will be able to retrieve your team’s info and you’ll be given an option to start recruiting. Once you click Recruit, you will be taken to a page where you will see your team’s info as well as all of the summoners looking to join a team. You will be able to see their basic stats, but if you want to see more detailed stats, you can click on their name and it will take you to their opgg. You can invite each summoner to join your team with a click of a button.

**Tournament automation:** 

After each clash tournament, the app will automatically update to the next upcoming clash tournament and filter out all of the old teams. That means, you don't have to worry about interacting with a team that will never respond to you. The teams you see are all new and actively looking to recruit teammates.

**TLDR:**

* I made a modern clash finder app for the community to use to find a team or teammates to play with

5vdddb1o,Lethioon,"For those who don't know, Kindred is the representation of death in Runeterra. (Well, no longer 'the' but still.) Lamb takes who accepts death while Wolf chases who tries to avoid it. Usually, they don't appear to mortals and you make your decision as you live, with your actions. However, it is possible for someone to see Kindred before their end  and be given a choice: Lamb's arrow or Wolf's teeth.

If you choose Lamb, your life will end right there. No pain, no struggle. Only a peacful sleep. You save yourself from the never-ending struggle of life and a lot of pain but whatever you leave behind will be forever unfinished. That book you've always wanted to finish, that travel you've always wanted to take none of them will ever happen. Is escaping from pain worth giving up on your only life? Will it have any meaning after you depart into your eternal rest?

If you choose Wolf, then the chase begins. It might last just a few minutes, maybe hours... or it might take days, months, even years. You might get the chance to finish your book, take that travel and do all the things you've wanted to do before you die. You get to expereince  more of this crooked but wonderful world. However, from now on, your life will be a constant struggle. Every moment in yor life will spent hiding and escaping from The Great Black Wolf. You will never find rest neither in life or death, for Wolf will make sure that your last moments are as painful as possible. And no matter how long you manage to hide, Wolf eventually finds everyone. Is clinging to that brief moments in life worth all the pain you have to go through? Is a life spent hiding and running really a life?

3hk2i9y5,aglimmerof,"I'm a bit of a lore nerd and I happen to love playing champs who have cool or interesting lore. I like to take that into the game and not necessarily 'roleplay' but more or less play the champ how I would imagine them in a cinematic like Warriors or Awaken.

It goes without saying I don't do this in Ranked.

Here are some examples:

* **E Max Jhin with Dark Harvest and a splash of AP.** Jhin strikes me very much as an 'execute' style champion rather than a speedy AA champion based on his lore (and his appearance in Awaken), which leads me to play him more slowly and methodically. The mines hurt a lot when you stack them on each other and max E. It is actually very artistically satisfying to see someone die from the blooming flower of your mines.
* **Full Burst Invisible Predator Kai'Sa.** Kai'Sa always seemed more like a predator/hunter to me, in a similar vein to Kha'Zix. I would go Duskblade first item, buy an AD component, get Q evolve, then go Nashor's and Zerk Greaves to get the E and W evolve, then transition into full AP for the raw passive burst damage. Sure it isn't exactly a *good* build, but it feels very thematic to me. Her constant disappearing into invisibility, only to reappear and execute another target. It feels very Predator film-esque to me.
* **AP 'Thor' Voli**. This isn't really a niche build as some people build him AP, but I always thought Voli from a lore perspective was more about channeling the power of thunder and decimating his enemies. I build two AP items (Riftmaker and Nashors) and then build tank. It makes me imagine a tanky thunder god.
* **Elemantalist Lux Skin.** If I am playing enchanter Lux Support, I'll go Water/Nature/Mystic/Ice because those strike me more as 'enchanter' style. If I'm going Full AP carry, I'll go Dark or Thunder. Although I almost never go Magma because I don't really like it haha.

And patch 11.9, Seraphine is number 8 in this patch right now, but the patch only came live 5 days ago so theres still time for it to change. 

If you wanna say pickrate, that really shouldn't matter because just look at the amount of matches they're played in. Its not like its 1000 matches with a high pickrate, its over 10000 games. Swain bot in this current patch has 2 losing matchups. 

Is this like a hecarim situation where were gonna have to wait months upon months for an actual sizeable nerf on either of them? Or is it just never going to happen?

I linked the winrate tierlist here if any of you want to see the numbers for yourself.

3fezlfdt,amlugion,"Before I start, I want everyone to understand this isn't some post complaining because I got chat restricted or whatever. This is about the fact that more often than not, people get banned for complaining about trolls than the trolls themselves, which doesn't make any sense.

The current system just reads chat logs and looks for certain nono words, even things like ""report this player"" can get you chat restricted/banned. I understand that sometimes people just constantly harass and spam threaten reports when someone might just be having a bad game, but that doesn't mean ""report"" should be a bad word. It just makes it impossible to get your point across.

The system needs to look at everything happening in-game as well, not just logs. If your jungler switches off smite or your support picks yasuo and starts dorans blade, saying ""report this person"" in all chat should NOT put you in the wrong. All it does is enable trolls, because they know as long as they are peaceful in chat they can get away with anything. 

The problem is that the ""intentional feeding"" section of reporting is pretty much useless. The only time someone gets banned for it is if they literally walk straight mid and die every time they respawn. That's not the only way you cant intentionally feed, so it shouldn't be the only way detected as feeding. 

Stealing farm, going for stupid plays on repeat but making it look like you're trying, sitting in someone else's lane to soak xp when you don't need to, all these things can completely ruin games and are done pretty often by people who are trolling. Even things pre game need to be accounted for, like taking stupid runes, putting useless summoner spells and picking champions in lanes they are not meant to go (not things like picking xerath support when he's meant to be mid, things like picking aatrox adc). Whether you've been autofilled or not should also be checked. If a mid main picks yasuo support, they are definitely trolling because they weren't given the role they want. 

I'm not saying people shouldn't get chat restricted/banned for spamming chat with complaints, but if this system of just checking who was mean and who was nice continues, trolls will most likely never get banned. All they have to do is be positive in chat and farm some minions/deal damage and the game will think ""hey this person is trying, they just got unlucky this game""",2021-05-03 01:50:46,3.0,n3bsr8

What I wanted to know is since Demacia is a Human kingdom, what would be expected from a foreign visitor who is not Human (A Vastaya visitor like Rakkan for example) in regards to addressing the Demacian populace, particularly the Demacian ladyfolk (Nobles and Non-Nobles alike). Are Demacian women to be treated with respect and honor?

With reworked items you don't really get that deathcap multiplying stats power feeling when you buy any items on support, you just stack endless mana regen for spamming spells.

I typically get on to play the occasional 1 or 2 solo games of Darius/Sion before getting off. At least from a standpoint where I play norms, it feels as if I'm literally being autofilled every game.

A week ago I got autofilled to Jungle on my main, swapped to my alt, got autofilled on that account to Jungle AGAIN, and at that point, I just quit the client and started up Destiny 2. I didn't even bother hopping on my main again to see if the dodge timer was up.

For instance Master Yi goes Duskblade crit instead on-hit builds. True damgae is barely there because of that. We already got KhaZix and Yi was suppose to be focused on-hit builds but currently with lack of on-hit mythic item on-hit Yi is ineffective.

Marksmen got many options they need - Kraken to deal with tanks, Galeforce for mobility and Shieldbow for surviving burst

On-hit champions have almost no choice but to go Kraken but that is for marksmen and is not that effective for on-hit builds

Current Rageblade has interesting idea but in practice does no do good for either on-hit builds or crit builds and when you buy it you just lose effectiveness in both cases

So my suggestion is to make Rageblade on-hit focused that clearly shows that you are going on-hit path

**Rageblade = Noonquiver + Recurved Bow**

40 attack damage

40% attack speed

unique: every 3rd hit applies on-hit 2nd time

unique - mythic: basic attacks does 20 magic damage on-hit + 20 per legendary item

&#x200B;

We already have the ability to ping various timers, objectives, summ. spells, etc and have it all show in chat, so *why* do we need to be able to type anything at all? 98% of my games people use chat to flame their team or enemy team. The other 2% is people actually being positive but that's extremely rare in this game and just not worth having chat.

&#x200B;

Having in-game chat just causes more grief than it's worth. For example, here's a screenshot of one of my games just today. Story: Everything was going mostly fine except toplane was feeding a bit. Happens. Nobody was saying anything but out of nowhere our Katarina typed in ALL chat to the enemy team. The enemy Kai'sa was taking our bot tower and our Samira was hiding in bot bush to ambush her. Katarina decided to tell the Kai'sa that Samira was there.

&#x200B;

I know I can disable chat completely in my games, and while this does help my own mental it doesn't help the other 4 people on my team. Many players don't even realize they can disable chat or they feel like they need to keep chat enabled for whatever reason. So while it helps my own mental, it doesn't help the other 4 people on my team.

**TLDR: Why doesn't RIOT just disable in-game chat? It's useless and encourages the toxicity in this game. Disable in-game chat and just keep post-game chat.**",2021-05-03 06:33:24,0.0,n3hpx3

I want to start off by saying I play well every game and still manage to remain at below a 50% win rate. Being a top laner, especially in season 11, is practically useless if your team decides its best to chain feed and give the enemy kai'sa 17 kills. Why even play top when bot lane is the only lane that matters? Why am I forced to give up the only champion I enjoy playing in this game just because I cant carry on him? Why am I forced to play a role and champ I don't find enjoyable just to gain consistent LP? But most importantly why am I facing an automatic loss even if I'm 12/3 just because my bot lane lost? Why every time I lose a game, its due to teammates underperforming? Straight up win lane lose game. Ill let this pic my of most recent 6 matches speak for itself:

Now, bare basic itemization kind of appeals to a list of hits and misses:*Is this item giving a unique effect apart from other items?What class(es) is this item's demographic?Are there champions who need this item?*

So, for example: Rapidfire Cannon*This item is made to poke by extending attack range and slightly buffing it's following attack.This item is purely aimed towards marksmen.Low range champions or champions with empowered attacks need this.*

AP Fighter itemization really right now is just Lich Bane and Nashor's Tooth.And well, looking at them both:*Lich Bane and Nashor's Tooth are AP counterparts of Essence Reaver and Rage(knife/blade).These items are aimed at* ***mages who utilize it.****Mainly melee mages need this.*

Anyways, I've been getting some eternals shards, but not for the champions I really want. On an alternate account I have I got an eternal for a champion I like and it was kind of fun to see it pop up in game as I dunked on my opponents.

When eternals came out, I and many others got mad at riot for monetizing it, and to some degree it is kind of annoying because some of these stats--especially all of those in the starter series--are so basic and should be automatically logged imo, but playing with the series 1 eternals has actually been kind of fun.

yw5af,ShinyGrezz,"So part of the reason ADCs have little power late game is that they lack experience, right? With a permanent ally leeching their minion experience, ADCs only gain 62.36% of the experience they would receive if solo. This causes the class as a whole to be rather useless unless ahead late game, which leads to certain strategies and playstyles becoming mandatory for a champion to be “meta”. Like how Ashe and Xayah, who provide a ton of CC for their team, were practically the only meta ADCs for a while. Or Lucian and Tristana, with their high mobility and relatively high burst, being meta (in sololanes as well, which I’ll get to) since it’s too dangerous to be a level 11 ADC at the mercy of a level 13 assassin. Or the Twitch/Kog’Maw and Lulu metas, whereby the entire team revolves around protecting the glass cannon. I don’t think every problem would be solved by what I’m about to suggest, but it would bring the overall power of the class up. And it just involves a new passive added to the support items.

>PASSIVE: This item can be used, once, to bind to an allied champion. When near the bound ally, this champion will not reduce the experience gained from minion kills for that ally.

It’s simple. By reducing the innate weakness of the class (lower innate level generation than other roles), ADCs as a whole will become more viable, rather than being reduced to meta picks. This will also allow the power of said meta picks to be lowered - as in the case of certain champions (like Lucian and Tristana) they’re often oppressive outside their role (once given an actual experience income).",2021-05-03 05:23:47,0.0,n3gbr0

I have kind of accepted the usual level of flaming and negative attitude in low leagues (and probably higher but I guess you know what I mean). You have a smurf every now and then but all in all It's something you can addapt to. A few days ago a friend of mine wanted to start playing lol and after a couple of years I got to see again what its like to level up (I myself did that in season 2 and I dont remember it beeing that bad back then).  


I can understand that you have smurfs down there but the amount of these was kind of shoking to me. She was lucky to have only 2 smurfs in her team. Usually it is around 70% smurfs in a given game. I dont really see why the game after 10 years isnt able to differntiate between smurf and low lvl player. Stats like constant farm above lets say 5 cs / min for levels below 10 or beeing with a kill to death ratio of more than 4 every game clearly states that you are either a smurf or simply too good for your opponents. Why doesn't the game puts these players together and lets low level players have their own game? It's so frustratig to see her dying every few mins to a 10-1 zed.

The worst thing about having all these smurfs is the flaming however. A lot of the smurfs don't really understand that they can't expect everyone on their team to play as good as them and constantly flame about the ""feeders"".

another point to make is people have adapted to the current meta and can survive in it, for example ""yeah yone is op but i can just pick x champ to not int to him in lane"" and if the meta changes and yone falls out of it and another champ like olaf top emerges then your champ that survived into yone will probably turbo int vs olaf

Rant Incoming

I've been playing League for 8 years now, and it's easy to say, that this is my favorite game. It hits every aspect I enjoy in games: strategy, high skill-cap, well-balanced macro and micro...

It even shaped my life in some way: I met several people that became very close friends of mine, I became an illustrator because I wanted to create similar paintings to the champion splash arts, I even got my first relationship because of this game.

Recently the game got really hard on me. Especially because of the whole covid-ordeal sometimes League is my only social interaction and it's a terrible experience. I really want to enjoy it, but people make it impossible for me. I always get into a game like ""oh hell yea, time for some league of legends, let's play \*insert champion here\* because I haven't played them for a while"", and it always ends with ""why do people have to ruin everything?"".

In general, I feel like most people don't treat League as a strategy game. I'm losing way too many matches because people are forcing random fights instead of taking objectives. I get it: It's much more fun to fight other people than to push minions, trying to counter jungle, ward important places or positioning so that the enemy cannot catch you, but if you want to play a game where you are constantly fighting play Cs:Go. Just recently I played a game where we lost an easily winnable game, where our ADC was flaming everyone because he was dying a lot and he said something like ""I don't wanna comeback I wanna stomp"".

Honestly, I wouldn't rant about this if this was a one-time thing, but the problem is that this is my general experience with League nowadays. People flame each other to oblivion. One person with a huge ego can lose the entire game for you because they refuse to believe that their opposing laner is just better. Or they are just blaming other people for their mistakes. We are not even talking about low-elo: I'm plat-diamond level.

Whenever I feel like playing a game, it just emotionally drains me for hours. I want to enjoy this game, I really want to but I feel like I have no influence over this.",2021-05-02 08:46:28,4.0,n2vjoh

bb6tenn,Trsddppy,"Before getting into whats wrong with it, let me prove i have a basic understanding of what clash tiers are. There are 4 tiers for clash teams, with low skill players being destined for tier 4, and high skill players being bound to tier 1. You can make a clash team with people from multiple tiers, but the team will get brought up to more difficult tiers as a result.

  
Except, thats not how it actually works. You can be put into higher tiers for no reason. how do i know? because my [account](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=dfg+trsdppy) is marked as tier 2 when im a silver/gold quality player. my account has no substantial statistics, i play clash with the same group every time. They are all tier 4, our skill is comparable to each other. But, being Tier 2, that pulls our team to tier 3. Last Clash, we played in tier 3, and it was a bunch of silvers on the enemy teams. We saw no distinction between tier 3 and tier 4 teams, which is very concerning because from what i understand, the skill difference between a diamond 4 player and a diamond 1 player is huge, and the bottom half of this system is hogged by players with little skill difference between them.

&#x200B;

When i noticed that i was Tier 2 for absolutely no reason, i submitted a ticket to Riot. The response i got told me two things. 1. riot will not audit your clash tier. 2. if the system in place puts you in a tier, it believes you should be in that tier.

Taric- you want heals? Other champs do that better. You want a tank support to peel for you? Braum does that better. You want a tanky engage support with cc? Leona does that better. Little range and too situational

Amumu- his ultimate is an AOE stun. Veigar has an AOE stun on an 8 second cool down that he doesn’t have to commit to the fight in order to use just for comparison. 

Hecarim- overnerfed too much sauce on that recent nerf

(It really is a better game xD) However I still play league, mainly because I still have friends who play. One big complaint I’ve been hearing about league recently and I totally agree is the auto fill system. This is where I really think riot should take notes: 

In Dota, if you solo queue, everyone has to play support once every 4 games.

Once you play your support game, you earn 4 tokens which guarantee you your queued role for the next 4 games. You can also queue as support multiple games in a row and stack up these tokens. Play 3 games of support in a row? Sweet I now have 12 guaranteed games of position 1 carry in a row which is my main role (equivalent of league’s adc) 

It’s such a better system, there’s no titling cause no one is randomly auto filled, and it forces everyone to learn support! It’s a win win situation. I really really think implementing this system in league would improve it so much. Thanks for reading :)",2021-05-02 18:56:23,0.0,n33zf4
7oqmfubi,Spirited_Jellyfish78,"I've seen a lot of talk about auto fill mostly coming down to people saying support or jungle is the most auto filled role. People will use stats of what roles people main or what is happening to a streamer. Yet, the biggest thing no one brings up is the human nature of each role. Supports are more likely to be duo'd so they will have a higher chance of playing more games. Also junglers are more likely to stop playing after a couple of games because of the toxicity towards the role. Some people will bring up secondary which is a mute point. Both roles are foreign compared to the others. Along with another thing with the duo factor if you pick adc you are more likely to get autofilled to jungle. The biggest reason at the end of the day is duoing. It's why in lower elo ADC is a less played role you dont really get autofilled.  When talking about things like this we have to take the human factor into account and not only take into account just random stats that we can make fit any narrative.

Now, I know Annie herself in the game is... pretty much up for debate- her long dark purple dress, cat ears and overall school girl appearance is only retained because it's iconic- and likewise I doubt she'll be remade / VGU'd anytime soon. The most noticeable change that has happened over the years for her was making her shield *a shield* so she can flex out of being a midlane-or-nothing champion- and work as a support. Also her appearance is overall the same in Wild Rift so, yeah.  


That aside, in the case where Riot were to randomly give her a visual update, ( on her models alone, since her effects still put Nightbringer Yasuo to shame. ) what exactly would she turn out like? What would she look like?  


I've been looking at LoR to see if there were any real leads but- all of the characters, as expected, look dressed to battle- let alone lack of younger youth.

Now, if you keep up with the lore, you may have noticed something: Chip talks of the Titan of Targon. Stonebreaker's flavourtext also talks about Targon.

Malphite's current story for those that are unaware is this: He is a shard from an Ixtali superweapon called ""the Monolith"" designed by Ne'Zuk to fight the  Void. The Monolith failed, crashed into the main Void rift and opened the rift even further, worsening the damage. The weapon was thought destroyed, until some of the shards tried to reform, and through the massive magics surrounding the area, the reformed shards gained sentience and sapience in the form of Malphite. You might notice that this story has nothing to do with Targon.

.

.

.

It should be noted that Targon, Ixtal and Shurima are all in the same continent, but are three separate regions with their own cultures and people, so people that are also a bit confused with his wording theorize that Malphite was ""Born"" in Shurima during Ne'Zuk's failure to create a superweapon to defeat the Void proper, and migrated to Targon and ""gave birth"" there, so Chip believes that Malphite has always been there.

The flavor texts mention Targon above Shurima and Ixtal, so I'm wondering: Did they retcon his story again to solidify him permanently in Legends of Runeterra?

3vlasd8n,killroywuzhere1,"I don't normally chime in regarding champion kits. Lord knows Riot has had plenty of practice with this. However, I just cannot understand the idea with Gwen here. Of all the champions I have seen in the years playing I have questioned a few for sure. However, a couple buffs here, some nerfs there, and the balance played out. However, in this case I don't think buffs are going to fix this champ because I feel her design is what's flawed. So I just wanted to give my thoughts on this champ:

***SPECIAL NOTE: I am not saying to use all of these ideas at once. I am merely stating that a combination of one or more of these ideas would be beneficial and round her out better. I also did not do any scaling math because that is not essential for these changes. Scaling can be changed but this is targeting the ""kit synergy"" aspect rather than the tangible damage output.***

# Sustain AP Melee Duelist's and why they don't work:

Gwen as I see it is a duelist. Like Fiora and Irelia it seems to me Gwen is built to engage deal some damage and escape. Her passive gives her sustain against champions with her basic attacks. Her Q is supposed to give her some quick bursts of damage at a relatively low CD and her dash gives her an attack speed steroid and magic damage on basic attacks. All of this should be great right? If the champion was AD maybe.

The problem with AP Melee duelists that rely on basic attacks to damage is they are horrible at sustaining themselves. Outside of ranged APC's such as teemo, most if not all of the AP based duelists have almost zero sustain abilities and in their place they have burst damage, cc, mobility, and mitigation damage (Ekko, Diana, Nidalee, Sylas, Fizz) to name a few. Usually these champs have extremely high mobility allowing them to dart around and engage when needed. Those that have healing, obtain it in chunks at the cost of longer cooldowns. Very few AP champions if any are in the same realm as Gwen for good reason.

Since your rework of the Item system, there have been few viable lifesteal / omnivamp items for characters like Gwen to pick from. Since she is AP based she suffers from not being able to really benefit from Lifesteal items in fear of sacrificing AP damage for you abilities. Thus she is stuck in limbo and her sustain doesn't really sustain.

# Passive:

Her passive heals her based on damage she deals to champions. However it only heals her from the magic damage buff she gets from it. Since that centers around max health. She really only benefits from this when facing tank champs. However, she doesn't have the dps to go in on Tank champs nor does she have the mobility or the CC I.E. an escape mechanic. This ultimately limits her engage and harass in favor of reacting to enemies when they engage or harass. I played a match against a Darius thinking the healing would at least allow me to eat some of the dot damage he does. However, this was an immediate mistake as the healing is barely anything at all.

**Potential Fixes?**

As it stands right now unless you changed her to AD instead of AP this cannot be remedied in my opinion to be effective. Sure you could increase her healing scaling or the percentage she heals per hit. However there are other abilities that might offset this without messing with this too much.

# (Q) is weak.

First lets talk about her horrible damage output on her (Q). Her scaling is garbage and yea you may have done an emergency buff to her. The damage is still horrible, and would be much more effective on an AD champ. However, if we have our heart set on keeping her AP we need to increase either the heal potential of this ability or the frequency of its use.

**Potential Fixes?**

Because the hitbox and range of her Q is so small. Players should be rewarded for landing the true damage hitbox of the attack on a champion either partially or the full hit. You could have her (Q) heal on the last large snip attack at the end. You can even increase its effect if Gwen has a full 4 stack of her (Q). That final hit in the true damage hitbox should heal her for a larger portion (maybe like a Sylas heal). This could either be something that she can use on both minions, monsters, and champs or just champs. I feel letting it heal for Large Monsters and Champions would be fair to her jungle game, but that's just me.

**-ALTERNATIVE IDEA-**

Allow the CD on her (Q) to be reduced per stack if she hits a target with her true damage hitbox. Each stack could be .5 seconds or 1 second. Or it could be 10% of her abilities CD this way it scales back as she levels. This could allow her to increase the frequency of her Q barrage when engaged in an ""all in"" skirmish. Or could be used when properly setup to punish an enemy that gets too close or decides to dive into her.

# (W) is not really that amazing:

The ""hallowed"" mist sounds great and the idea that is prevents her from being hit by anything outside of it is nice. However, the fact that it has such a large radius with no way to control where its dropped really defeats any real advantage it has top lane (since it drops centered on her). Specially when a mass majority of top laners are in fact up close fighters. So it blocks attacks at a distance but does nothing to anyone up close to her. More importantly, the only benefit she gains inside of it is armor and magic resist? Not really the most efficient idea. Ultimately this is really good for ganking as it allows her to avoid being CC'd, or damaged on her approach. However in lane it really just suffers.

**Potential Fixes?**

First idea is to take a page out of Kindreds book. While in the mist Gwens (E) should cool down faster. This can either be accomplished much like Kindred by simply reducing the overall CD while she's in it, or you could reduce the CD based on her auto attacks while in the mist. This would promote both aggressive playstyles and could be helpful for escaping. All in all making her more mobile in the mist than out of it.

**-ALTERNATIVE IDEA-**

If you wanted to give Gwen some more dps you could have it damage the opponent when they are inside of it. Rather... damage the opponent when she is attacking them inside the mist. The damage would be DOT damage and would only last like .5 to 1 second after each attack, but would reapply each time she hits someone. You could spin it like the mist is hallowed and anything she attacks is deemed evil and the mist attacks it. Who knows, but the DOT damage could be increased by AP scaling and would act like a liandry's burn so to speak.

# (E) Is a one way street when it should be two ways:

I don't really have a lot to say about (E) as it has some good stuff to it. However, the thing that doesn't work for me is the fact that the frequency of use is too low. The wording of the ability doesn't make sense either. It say's ""attacking an enemy during this time refunds 50% of this abilities cooldown"". It does not however say that it only reduces it once. It says ""attacking and enemy during this time"". To me that means if I hit the enemy 2 times during the duration. Then her (W) should be ready to cast again since two hits would reduce the CD by 100%. However, I do not feel like this is functioning that way.

**Potential Fixes?**

As mentioned above the only thing that needs to be fixed is it's accessibility. There needs to be a way to increase the frequency of use. The way it is reduced now, does not help enough. If she had the ability to dart in and out like Fiora. Then I think she would feel more suitable for top lane duels.

# OR JUST MAKE HER AD:

The last possibility is just making her an AD champion. This would resolve a lot of issues with her kit design without many of the reworks mentioned above. The reason is due to the fact she would have more accessibility to things like Lifesteal, attack speed, crit change/damage, etc. Making her a more fierce sustain champion.

Anyways... just my thoughts.

8uonc18g,eleithan,"Riot intends to change punishment for repetitive AFK. I think these changes are merely symptomatic and not radical enough. Here is my line of thought.  
So, what are possible reasons to go afk? Actually.... There are none!  


1. You started the game. You hit ""accept"" and locked in a champ. We can assume that you play this game because you chose to do so. No one forces you to. You voluntarily decided to play with 4 other people.
2. An emergency (your mother died, your baby brother fell down the stairs and broke something). Go afk. You will be punished, but it wont bother you. Your mother just died. You wont care about a minor punishment in an online game.
3. You know that you need to take a very important call? Dont play then. Your boss likely calls you at 12? Guess you cant play after 12 if you have to take that call. Ringing phone is no excuse to afk.
4. You get a random call / ring at the doorbell? You are not available atm. You are playing League. You expect visitors? DONT PLAY THEN.
5. Your internet is bad. Well, just one thing you can do about that. DONT PLAY. You cant play soccer with a broken leg. You cant play LoL when you got 7 seconds lag. Not happening. 
6. You missed a deadline / an important date? Your problem. See 1. 
7. You want to afk bc another player annoyed you / doesnt do as you say? You as a player should be removed.  


The average LoL game goes between 15 and 30 minutes. During this time, you have to focus and stay active. If this is too much or demanding for you, dont play teamgames.  
Some might consider this line of thought radical or unsensitive, and I will answer that with a question: If this was a real life game like soccer - what do you think would happen if you go afk in a RL match? The coach would kick you out and your team would be rightfully royally pissed at you, perhaps even beat you up as you let them down.  
I think we should do it online as in real life.   


SOLUTION: Put the afks in a separate queue. Make their queue dodge timer 15 minutes by default, even if they did not afk the previous match. Flag the summoners name and make it obvious that this player frequently afks. Reduce their essence gain by 50% or more.   
If that does not suffice, delete their account and have them start from scratch.

I think it might be because it is a mac, but I want to see other people's opinions.There are 2 ways that I leave the game:

1. I load into the game very late, and cannot tell that I am loading in late unless I am playing with someone on call. I have to quit league and reconnect, and even this overall takes 4 minutes to load in, missing a lot of levels and gold. Once in a party with my friends, I tried to see how long it would take if I just didn't do anything. **5 minutes**. It took 5 minutes. If I were to play with random people (e.g ranked), by that time we would've ffed and I would've been reported.
2. Sometimes (this started happening around a week ago), it just quits league. For no reason. I could just be walking to lane, not pressing any buttons or commands and it just quits league for me. This is actually more alarming, as I cannot predict when this will happen and it's a sure-fire way to get leaver queue",2021-05-02 08:45:00,0.0,n2vitx

i find an interesting challenge on chinese league's forum.

Here is the goal of this trial
Get a B.F. Sword as fast as u can.
Here's the rule

You need create a custom mode game with no bot,not practice tool.

You can choose any champ.

You can use any runes without Future's Market.
 
You can get gold by any means.

The moment you successfully buy a B.F. Sword, the game time in the upper right corner is your final score.

Sounds simple,right?

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"This is just simple plain ability ideas that are mostly on their own, and fully depend on what the rest of a champions kit is, along with it being either an Ultimate, Passive or just an Q/W/E ability.

* **Radical Yo-crobatics:** The User begins to make a cleave motion with it's Yo-yo. If the move connects, it begins swirling the Yo-Yo around them in a circle, allowing them to use 3 moves from that phase. Q makes them throw the yo-yo straight before it go backwards to behind the user hitting the front and right behind them. W makes them use the Yo-Yo as a skill shot that sends them to that direction when the skillshot ends, and E has the user spin the yo-yo around them rapidly, acting like a more damaging variation of Mundo's W for up to 1.5 seconds.
* **Seed of Force:** Similar to Illaoi and Zyra, this champ can place stationary pets that will attack for them. Unlike the two, this happens if the champ lands an auto attack to *anything instead of having it happen by it's own, or killing a unit.* Wards, enemy Champions, minions, objectives, even other parts of an enemies kit such as Malzahar's voidlings or Annie's Tibbers can count as placing a stationary plantation. A mix between this and Yorick, in that the Q turns into a pet activation for the champ to summon the plants from it's auto attacks. Up to 5-6 stacks in total around the champs AOE affect. Goes on a cooldown after the pets are summoned.
* **Pin-Shot:** An straight skillshot that bounces off of any terrain that connects. The more bounces it does, the more true damage it deals once it hits an enemy champion. Up to 2/3/4/5-ish bounces per level. Passes through units other than enemy champions and Jungle Monsters.
* **CHIPS AWAY!:** Upon activation, the champ would receive a massive speed boost, along with a single use of a dash. Once activated, the champ would be allowed to throw AOE bombs (Akin to Zigg's Ult in terms of what the skillshot is like) while moving, similar to Taliyahs Threaded Volley. Each bomb deals huge magic damage, and can be thrown up to around 4 times, each leaving a pile of flames that deals further magic damage the more they touch it after the next. However the 4th bomb would stun anyone hit by it.
* **Temp Exhaust:** The champion does a dash that leaves out a fiery exhaust behind them, dealing magic damage. However, if the champ waits long enough, it increases the range of it's next dash. If the dash range is full, the exhaust would then deal bigger magic damage. Meaning you either want to save the dash to close a further gap at the expense of the dash for close range combat, or use the dash frequently to cement this but lose the potential damage and range.
* **Hitch ya Ride:** The champ begins to literally take a ride off of a wall on a terrain, moving a lot faster as the champ grinds on it. If they activate it again, they do a simple dash off of the terrain. However, they can do a short hop to another terrain close to them, but it only happens once per ride.

On another note, this game is literally rigged. I was in winners queue until I got into my promos, and then I get the biggest dunkeys. People saying winners/losers isn't a thing are d*lusi*nal, because it's a thing.

""BUt YoU'Re SilVer, YoU cAN't HAvE an OpiNion On THis GAmE"", I know I'm kinda hardstuck but this matchmaking isn't helping either. The one game I lost might've been my fault but you literally can't not be carrying the game in low elo, in order to win your game.

It's a team game after all right? That's what people are telling hardstuck people. However, how can you play as a team, when your top is literally just running it down and you as an ADC can't go in range of 50meters of a Darius, or else you're just dead.

4ffvev5v,Tannir48,"So I've been [stuck in platinum](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Doesnt) for the last 9 months, bouncing between platinum 4 0lp and platinum 2 91lp (my peak). My winrate had been around 50% losing about as many games as I won. Recently this got a lot worse where I dropped a lot of games, my overall wr dropped to 47% and my mmr was gold 2  with my plat demotion shield expiring. Naturally, I didn't expect to see any good lp gains. At that time, I was gaining 12 and dropping 18.

I think that's fair for someone who's lost a bunch of games and saw their mmr plummet to significantly below their rank. I shouldn't be gaining as much as I lose with a negative winrate, let alone more, if I'm consistently losing.

In the last week I've gone on a big winning spree, winning about 69% of my last 51 games...

Yet the entire time my lp gains have barely improved at all. I went from +12/-18 to +13/-17 after this. Why? Because according to [this site](https://na.whatismymmr.com/Doesnt), my mmr is just as fucked as it was before I started winning. 

&#x200B;

[My streak started around April 21 and my mmr has improved by 200 since then](https://preview.redd.it/hjrq0xku4lw61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=5226bea6488ed6faea1a58d2ae3ff31d28817420)

When I started the streak I was plat 4 0lp with gold 2 mmr. Now *I am plat 2 9lp with plat 4 mmr*. My mmr is increasing but does not seem to be increasing **proportionally** to how much I'm winning and, as I understand it, my lp gains are reflecting that.

It's been really rough climbing with these gains yet I've gained **209lp** in just one week. I don't understand why my mmr isn't significantly improving or why I still need to win 2 games to compensate for one loss. Does anyone understand how the mmr system works and can explain this to me?

If one more champion that cancels skillshots is released we will be in a frustrating spot for mages and poke champions, were in almost every match there will be someone cancelling them on team fights. Poke comps are not out of control, I don't get why that mechanic is getting popular.

What we truthfully need is a champion with an anti-dash mechanic that CANNOT be stopped by windwall-y skills. Both cassiopeia and singed skills can be countered by the same champions they were supposed to counter.

I since I never watched any streamers (other than my baby Quantum) and I ain't addicted to climbing at the point of sweating and dripping salive onto my keyboard, have made my own though that Riot And LoL are fine games.

Riot: Only 2 complaints and things to change that I can remember are

1)More fucking communication, I hated when the EUW sever went down for a DDos for a week and they didn't fucking say a thing about it

2)The MMR system, it's not good, nothing more to say just start from the beginning with that shit and change it

LoL: the only complaint that comes to mind is the community, but it's not Riot's fault or the game's fault (Mind you, I just can't remember so there are definitely some more errors, I just don't remember any atm)

I only highlighted the complaints because there are 999 good things and 4 bad things, so it's just easier. Now I want to hear someone's though that hasn't been corrupted by the mass and I'll reply with my counter argument or my agreement",2021-05-03 20:01:42,858.0,n3u8on

khn5h,mfunebre,"To my dear friends in the League of Legends subreddit, I trust this letter finds you in good health. Forgive me for my lack of correspondance over the past few weeks, but recently other more worldly matters have demanded my utmost attention.

I write to you today in deepest melancholy. Yesterday, my friends and I attempted to play Clash. I am currently ranked Gold 4 (quite an improvement since my last letter you will agree, if you would pardon me the indulgence of a moment of personal satisfaction), and my teammates are mid-low Platinum. Yet upon my arrival in our Clash bracket I was most displeased to discover that my opponents for this evening's first game were to be a full house of Masters and Diamond 1 players. Not only that, but should we have triumphed over them through what I can only imagine to be a series of very unlikely events, the second team we were slated to face was comprised of four Diamond 1 players and a Master player.

To reiterate: I am Gold 4 0LP and, according to my most recent SoloQ teammates, hardstuck at that. O! why must I match up versus the top 0.3% of EUW athletes? Surely, in all the vastness of League's international player base, there are five other players closer to my level? I know that one of my friends is currently in Loser's Queue, but I find it very unfair that this should extend to Clash too.

As a result, my team's amusement was cut short as we immediately surrendered, insulted that the tournament organisers would seek to humiliate us so by offering us up as nothing more than an amuse-bouche against these titans of eSport. I expect a full reimbursement of our entry fee and a signed letter of apology, as well as a *thorough* investigation into the root cause of this matchmaking faux-pas. I consider it very poor form on the organizer's part to set up such a dishonourable travesty. This is akin to asking that Jackson Paul fellow to fight the ever-pecunious Sir Floyd Mayweather.

Alas! I fear this may have been the final straw for my teammates, whose incredulous displeasure far surpassed my own. 'Twere already a herculean task to rally the troops for this final bout, as several recent losses and the laughably poor recompense for such a chronophageous investment had already doused somewhat their competitive fires. Perhaps it is time to move on and search for a more uniform line-up. A pity; for these fine fellows are among the best comrades a gentleman could wish for, and our merry times on the battlefield have been a highlight of this season's sport. In the spirit of recreating anew such a colourful squad, would you be interesting in partaking of a sip of that most bittersweet beverage, competition?

Strong objective control with her R

The only reason i can think of why she isn’t being played is that the jungle meta has been speed boosts instead of dashes which she isn’t great against. She’ll do much better if the jungle meta switches up to early gankers like J4 or lee sin whom she counters.

I propose ideas to make a better build path for Guinsoo Rageblade and adding a new one ""magic damages oriented"", which can improve (not much) the current state of onhit, this season.

""Reverting Rageblade/Making it a Mythic"" probably isn't an option that is going to be made.

So, I propose to buff Guinsoo Rageblade Attack Speed to 50%, like it was in preseason (but physical onhit). This will allows to improve build path and to not waiting for 1100 gold to be able to purchase it.

It will allows us to purchase other Marksman Mythics without losing to much Attack Speed for not going Kraken. Guinsoo + Shieldbow/Galeforce (both 20% AS) should have more room to go rather than always Guinsoo + Krarken (25-75% AS).

And I propose ""Hextech Rageblade"" mostly for **AP Champs**. But if it's end up to be a balance problem for **AD Champs** then giving AP instead AH, and magic onhit based on AP (like nashors tooth) can be a solution.

To avoid ""Hextech Rageblade"" synergize to well with certains Mythics, Ignoring/lowering an amount of damages from Mythics passives which gives AH, can be a solution (**Only AH from mythics passives** convert damages by a lowered amount). 

Items choices to build with Hextech Rageblade are :

\- **Going for only 2 Ability Haste Items (Mythic + Hextech Rageblade) then other options** 

*Like champs who goes for 2 Crits Items (Mythic + Guinsoo Rageblade) then other option (Botrk/Wits/Defensives)*

**- Going for others Ability Haste Items to empower magic damages**

4vmqi,averysillyman,"Spellsy, the Director of Operations at Golden Guardians, recently made a twitter thread about how sad he felt the content coming out of LCS teams was.

The TL;DR summary is in this image:

[Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0fKx5RVgAM9mku?format=png&name=small)

Basically, in terms of youtube engagement, you have TSM, 100T, and C9 with the largest numbers. Then TL and FLY with middle of the pack numbers. And then the other half of the LCS teams basically might as well not have youtube channels at all, given that they are running on below 10k views per month on their content.

In comparison, Spellsy included the new youtube channel that Golden Guardians made for their Super Smash Bros Melee content, which is already rivaling the top LCS teams in terms of watch metrics, despite being about a game that is significantly less popular than LoL.

He also included an second image, comparing LCS numbers to some other gaming youtube channels.

[Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0faOerVUAI9kuf?format=png&name=360x360)

As you can see here, even the big LCS channels are only a fraction of the size of channels from other games. For example, the NRG channel (mostly fortnite content) and the C9 Valorant channel both have over 4 times the average monthly views compared to the largest LoL channel (TSM). And there's no comparison between LoL content and something mega-popular like Toast's Among Us videos, which have approximately 100 times the monthly views.

What do you think LCS teams could do to better engage viewers? Even though a team like TSM is very successful compared to other LoL teams, they're still small fish compared to a lot of other games. And it doesn't feel like a team like IMT is doing a particularly good job at building a lasting fanbase when their videos are basically getting no views. Especially for a game of LoL's size, there really should be a bigger opportunity space for teams to be able to take advantage of in terms of media/content production.

Personally I think teams should maybe make a bigger effort in putting out more unscripted content. For example, hire an editor to produce solo queue highlights for their LCS and Academy players. You already have streamers that are fairly successful at doing this, so why can't I watch TL's botlane crush it in solo queue while joking with each other over comms? Maybe have a podcast where once a week or two you could get some players to sit down and talk about the patch or about some of the cooler LCS matches or whatever. Or make consistent patch rundown videos or champion reveal analysis videos like LS does. Or just have the players do non-LoL related things for clickbait content. Any of this would allow fans to have a greater exposure to the personalities of new LCS players, and therefore become more attached to their success and their team's success. And this sort of content is much easier to produce than something scripted like TSM Legends, because for the most part a lot of this content could be accomplished in a single take with a minor bit of editing, thereby allowing you to put out more videos each month and keep fan engagement high.

And yet, even before his nerfs, he remains a ridiculously low playrate champion. I don't azir as significantly more difficult than the likes of Yasuo and Irelia, yet his playrate suggests otherwise.

9pty231,Elidot,"Hey there, something is worrying me recently and that is the state of Lillia and especially her future inside the game.

TL;DR Lillia is pretty bad right now and future changes to the game as a whole hurt her further and there is currently nothing said by Riot in regards to her current state.

Many of you might not have noticed but Lillia is currently sitting at [an incredibly low winrate of 44,5%](https://u.gg/lol/champions/lillia/build), which not only is the lowest winrate inside the jungle position but its actually the lowest winrate for *any* champion in the game in their most played/intended role and even if we count offroles with decent enough pickrates, Lillia is second to last [according to u.gg](https://u.gg/lol/tier-list).

While a low winrate is nothing new for Lillia because shes been hovering between 46-48% winrate since her release, she has reached an all time low even for her standards.'So why isnt she simply buffed?' You might wonder. Well its simple: Pro play. She has been a staple pick in proplay since her release, this pro presence actually even got her nerfed on [Patch 11.6](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Lillia/LoL/Patch_history) even though she was already sitting on a [sub 46% winrate](https://u.gg/lol/champions/lillia/build?patch=11_5) in patch 11.5, on top of that she also received multiple indirect nerfs that very same patch through Ravenous Hunter, Liandries and Seekers.

There have been multiple posts on this subreddit about how well Lillias balancing was done and I mostly agreed with them but as time went by and especially after she was directly nerfed I found myself worrying about her state.

Despite her low Solo Q performance her pro presence is still too high for Riot to buff her for Solo Q, sounds familiar? Lillia is currently in the same notorious spot Ryze, Azir or Akali are usually to be found. Yet there hasnt been a single statement by Riot (or atleast I havent seen one) that says that Lillia is getting worked on to fix this issue. Which, honestly, was already raising concerns for me personally.

Last week [Riot published planned changes to the Jungle position as a whole](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-april-30/), which all in all I am glad to see as a Jungle player since it brings change to the current farm meta we have and could bring more new players to the position. However these changes are very concerning as a Lillia player at the same time. Lillias prime strength is her high clearspeed which in theory makes her a good fit for the current meta, as I explained earlier this doesnt really translate to her actual performance in Solo Q, even in [higher MMR](https://u.gg/lol/champions/lillia/build?patch=11_5&rank=diamond_2_plus). The current Jungle change list seems to mainly benefit ganking Junglers: reintroduction of catchup exp, smite value changes and Camp respawn timers in particular. Lillia isnt exactly a good ganker and prefers to just jump through her jungle farming camps.

To add insult to injury: the Item rework didnt really help her either, most AP Items are bad and basically carried by the even worse MR itemization. Lillia is an AP skirmisher meaning she wants AP but at the same time wants to not get oneshot immediately so she cant really go for pure Mage Itemization, yet currently shes being forced into pure Mage itemization since AP skirmisher Items simply dont exist or are vastly undertuned. This doesnt even seem to be on Riots radar since they didnt mention new AP Items when they talked about adding new Items in the latest [lol pls video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIez_vtlg-I).

So what can be done to help Lillia? The first thing is that the Jungle changes have to be tested thoroughly and that the changes meet their intended goals. The next thing is that the champions who are majorly underperforming with these changes in place are getting properly compensated, Lillia should be one of those champions as I explained earlier.

If despite the Jungle changes Lillia continues her current trend of being the Jungles Azir then theres only one option: a powershift/rebalance. What in particular needs to be done in that regard is a whole 'nother discussion in its self, but personally Id like to see her getting loosened from the powerfarm playstyle (reduced clearspeed) and get some Utility reduced from her kit (E spam playstyle, R sleep duration) in trade for more durability (base stats, in fight sustain) and a better W (not a completely new spell just one where it isnt troll to use the spell when the enemy isnt cc'd).

1jp3o3bx,Morlino,"Ignite is obviously very strong summoner spell for assassins, giving them extra kill threat. Or on it makes sense supports, since it cuts ADC's heal to secure a kill.

But if you look at it from a mage perspective, it doesn't make much sense. Yes, it helps to win the lane and the extra damage is always nice, but if you compare it to TP, I can't think of a situation why would Viktor, Syndra or Azir take Ignite over TP.

Mages need at least 1 item (Luden/Liandry) to start playing, so TP makes perfect sense since in most teamfights you try to position safely and you won't be able to reach anyone except tank with ignite, so it seems too risky to get a full value off of it in a teamfight.

It does not only help with mid-game CSing, without worrying about being able to join an upcoming teamfight for an objective, it also may be as strong as ignite in laning phase: play aggressive early levels, pop all your potions and make enemy mid laner waste his, freeze the wave and TP back with full charge of corrupting potions and some tear/dark seal or whatever you have money for. And that's it, you have all your potions and an item. And if the enemy has the ignite his lane is doomed, unless his jungler helps to crash the wave.

qb2w0b,leaguefan018," Just queued up with 2 friends and we get placed on a team of all golds while our opponents have a master, 3 diamonds, and a plat. Sad to say, but this is a regular occurrence in flex. The matchmaking system completely ignores your solo/duo rank and goes solely off how you're ranked in flex??? Just by playing a good amount of flex this season and climbing to my solo/duo rank, all of my flex games with friends result in us facing teams where our average rank is 1-2 FULL TIERS (i.e. Diamond 2 vs Gold 2) below our opponent. This has made flex pretty much unplayable and leaves no ranked mode to play when you have more than 1 friend online. I wish Riot would fix this, but sadly seeing how other aspects of the game like the client have stayed so poor for so long I don't have a lot of hope. Wondering if anyone else experiences issues with this?

1qthi0fw,CallMeFJR,"With this many items and champions the game it feels the game is impossible to fully balance, as changing one thing will just make something else disproportionately stronger in meta. There will always be a few champion/item combinations that are the strongest thing to do in a vacuum, even if there are counters in the game.  

While the new item system did prevent the game from becoming stale, it also exacerbated this issue of balance and introduced huge changes that have swung the meta dramatically. Goredrinker made stuff like Renekton, Olaf and Aatrox insane until the item was knecapped. Moonstone gave healers an insane spike and made healing too good. Sunfire made Amumu a soloqueue nightmare. Chemtank gave power farming champions incredible power to gank and dominated a full split of pro play. 

I'm not saying Riot is a bad company or anything like that, if anything I give them credit for refusing to lock the game into a static form and I wouldn't suggest ""reverting"" the items. But will there ever be an acknowledgement that these huge swings in the meta where a few options are way stronger than everything else is not healthy and that the item rework has been a huge problem in terms of balance? They obviously acknowledge it with patches, but is it unreasonable to expect Riot to state what they are happy and disappointed with from the item rework?

Hi everyone,

I've posted this on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/shacomains](https://www.reddit.com/r/shacomains), and some people suggested me to post it even here:

Knowing that a lot of people find that making a rework for ap Shaco without breaking Shaco jungle is impossible I decided to spend my free time of the last two months trying to define and fix ap Shaco's problems, making a lot of mathematical analysis. Plus I tried to rework the ultimate for both ad and ap.

At the link you'll find a shared directory of google drive (not my personal email, but one created specifically for this) in which there are:

* a pdf with all the analysis
* two file.ggb that you can open thank GeoGebra and have a look at most of the functions
* a file.txt that is a guide to the usage of the two file.ggb

I suggest an IDEA of possible rework (I think that is also quite good) but it has to be play tested. Some of the changes can be removed, but some of them not.. Remember the main objective of this work is to show that a rework to ap Shaco without breaking ad Shaco is possible, and that ap Shaco needs a rework to be played top.

Before yelling ""UNBALANCED"" try to think why I proposed those changes and their impact to the game for Ap Shaco and Ad Shaco, but if you still think that some of them are unbalanced or you have some questions or you think something is wrong, please feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section so that we can find a solution together.

Please please, even if you're ad Shaco junglers, give me a shot and read my pdf, there is so much potential and the moment we are now is perfect for a Shaco rework.

Thanks!

Bests,

Nghtmr27

8n09jsbr,TooEsoteric,"Just played a game against yone, and I got reminded of how weird this champion really is.

Almost no-risk engage is just ridiculous in my opinion (especially for a mid laner / adc). Imo, there should be a risk when just engaging braindead with his \`Sould Unbound\`. I think there are 2 very good nerfs for this, which are practical and do not 'nerf him to the ground':

1. His \`Soul Unbound\` gets 'cancelled' when he gets total cc'd and he can not snap back into his body. Instead, his body snaps to his soul.
2. He can only snap back to his body if he gets a champion takedown, otherwise, his body will snap back to his soul (yes he can use his \`Soul Unbound\` as an escape, but this is fair imo).

Either way, there will be at least a decent amount of thinking required before engaging. The player will have to actually decide, is it \*smart\* to engage? Now he just yeets himself in continuously, without taking any real risk.

What is even more annoying, is that items the like of Zhonia are literally useless against him as he can just keep engaging every 10 seconds with his \`Sould Unbound\`, add a solid lifesteal build and he just hits 2 minions, and can engage again, which just seems prepostorous to me.

I am no pro player or anything, but considering that there are many champions that behave similar to the 2 suggestions, it seemed like a fair idea to me.

He isn't abused in any role he wasn't intended to be played and he isn't abusing tank build. 

His winrate will start going down to about 50% but right now he just isn't respected. I see so many people just choose to tank his W damage and I don't blame them because prebuffs I did the same.

- Qiyana, actually really similar to Aphelios when it comes to the hype and subsequent letdown. If there's any (relatively) recent champion that I would call rushed, it's this one. What an absolutely awful execution on a really fun idea. The fact that the elements only have an effect on her q's is just sad, and her ult is underwhelming when you consider the possibilities. Could've been some sort of Heimerdinger ult, where each element changed it a bunch. But instead she's just kinda meh.

7aee179d,mpf118,"My friends and I just started playing LoL about 1-2 months ago. I wanted to try Senna and my friend wanted to try Lux. Since we each don't have the champion we want but have the other person's wanted champion, we swapped accounts and played in one pvp match.

Here is my question: I am in the US, and my friend is in Sweden (we both select NA server). When I play my account, I never see +300 or more XP after a match, regardless of my actual performance, while my friend always have significantly more XP. I had thought that it was because I had a bad history of performance with my account.

When we swapped accounts, my account that she was using in Sweden got 430 XP after the match, although her letter graded performance was worse than mine (playing on her account).

Has anyone else come across something like this? If not the actual account and the performance in a match, what determines how many XP is given?

So Riot's changing the jungle again... big surprise there considering every year they've tried to change the jungle as a way to spice up the game. But these changes may introduce a new meta that no one really likes anyways - the ""level 3 into perma gank"" meta of junglers. I don't know about anyone here but I personally don't mind ganks but when they're happening all the time it gets really, really annoying. ""Oh hi there Lee Sin? This is the... fifth time you've visited in the past 3 minutes? Can you fuck off, man? I'm trying to lane here.""

No but seriously, this plus comeback experience being reintroduced and changes to Smite are overall going to make the jungle role less about skill expression and more about ""me jungle me smite me win the game"" and I don't mean this to insult.

First, let's address what the jungle meta is right now. It's all about the full clear and most of the meta junglers are pretty good at full clearing their camps pretty fast. This means that most junglers aren't impacting their lanes early and it makes bad matchups feel worse and good matchups feel like you're on top of the world. It's not the worst meta but it means that screwing up early is likely to put you very behind as the jungler doesn't want to change his pathing to help you out.

The new meta that it seems might be shaping up is going to be the level 3 permagank meta - think junglers like Elise, J4, Lee Sin, Xin Zhao, etc. Full Clearing (assuming that comeback experience is being reintroduced) will be less effective as it won't really matter if you fall behind in levels or CS in the jungle since the game will help you catch up and be relevant in no time. Catchup experience will help in low elos especially if your jungler is autofilled, but it sort of takes away the skill expression behind invades and setting the enemy jungle behind. (Why try when they'll just catch up?) It also takes away some of the value of junglers that scale up over time. Why play Master Yi who takes 25 mins to come online when you could just pick Xin Zhao, gank more times than the enemy jungle, and get all your lanes ahead before the enemy can even look to influence the game AND catch up on XP later on after your lanes are won?

The changes to Smite are the real problem but there are some nicer changes with it. First, it removes skuttle shield and deals its full damage to the crab. That's nice for jungle diversity overall but most of the meta junglers have some way to remove the shield anyways, so this is a pointless change in my opinion. Next, Smite is changing to deal flat 500 True Damage on base Smite and 1000 True Damage on enhanced Smite. This is going to level the playing field, but not in a good way. One of the ways you can show how good of a jungler you are is to get a lead in XP and ultimately make it impossible for the enemy team to out-smite you since your Smite does way more damage. This just takes that away.

Overall, I think the changes are not good and Riot should go back to the drawing board on the Smite changes. Catch up XP is alright by itself but these changes all put together are just not a good idea.",2021-05-04 00:16:59,0.0,n405wx

It is already a common thing that people try champs for the first time in rank games and I do believe that this is a problem. My games got influenced in a negative way by this (or positively, based on which team the person is playing). So I came to the conclusion that Riot could put the Mastery level to good use and let players only use champions on which they have got a certain level (In the same way you can't play rank if you don't have a certain number of champs/ you have to be lv 30)

bmxj9xlq,Alyxzr,"My idea:

Make teams six players. 

Your roles for queuing are now 

**Jungle / Roamer**

(Roamer is basically a jungle-based support role, maybe with a unique item like the Jungle weapon which allows the Roamer to gain experience and gold from roaming around the map, maybe by collecting things like Senna and Thresh or by harvesting camps like Ivern. This would make far more champions capable of playing in the jungle and loads of potential for new champion ideas for roaming supports like Bard) 

**\[Top Solo\] or \[Top Carry / Top Support\]**

**\[Mid Solo\] or \[Mid Carry / Mid Support\]**

**\[Bot Solo\] or \[Bot Carry / Bot Support\]**

This could free up the meta, making drafting and team comp more interesting. It would create a much more dynamic game with way more strategic potential and a greater variety of ways to play and win.

I'm not sure how champ select would work but for example you could have teams with really unique comps like

TOP

Darius \[Solo\] VS Nocturne \[Carry\] / Soraka \[Support\]

JUNGLE

Viego \[Jungle\] VS Karthus \[Jungle\] / Thresh \[Roamer\]

MID

Ryze \[Carry\] / Morgana \[Support\] VS Yone \[Carry\] Yasuo \[Support\]

BOT

Vayne \[Solo\] VS Jhin \[Solo\]

May seem like Darius is fucked but Viego could play towards top? 

May seem like Jhin is fucked but Yasuo or Thresh could roam? 

This also frees up ADC champions being solo in lane to be normalised. Many are being played solo top and mid now anyway. Also emphasises the strengths of the current meta with roaming supports being as influential as junglers and makes for different types of ganks / dives / early game strategies.

Hi guys, 

I need your help and opinion here. I have some bunch of people who like spending their time together playing some table games, placing small amount of money. For example, poker. 

And I was thinking the other day - do we have any solid platform where average John’s friends can play league of legends and win the prize? I mean just a game, not a tournament.

Let’s say I have my team of five on cozy Fri eve, so we decided to try our luck. The platform should give us two options:

1) accept someone’s request from the list by matching the bet
2) place a request where bet (some peanuts we ready to lose), type of the map, time and date are mentioned

It should be simple: either we call the bet either some team calls ours bet. After match winner gets the money.

Of course, we should be able to filter calls by rank, region, making sure that agreed terms on the bet will be followed by both team and etc.. I know that cheaters might also be an issue here, but let’s put it aside for a moment. Let’s focus more on the main idea. 
Generally, what do you think about such approach? Specifically during COVID time, where a lot of people are starting to play egames.",2021-05-03 20:11:06,1.0,n3uenh

I feel like these are the best runes:
Comet
Manaflow
Trascendence
Gathering Storm

Footwear
Biscuit Delivery

(Adaptive-Adaptive-Armor)

I reckon that this is the best rune page because you get free boots (since the build is kinda expensive) and you get a lot of mana (with manaflow and biscuits), so you don't have to buy tear (so you don't have to use 400 gold for that).

I usually max abilities like this:
R>E>Q>W

For the starting item I go for Spellthief, but if I am against an hard engage team comp I go Relic Shield.
I build Imperial Mandate because it's a support item so it's pretty cheap, and it procs with E.
Then I go Rylai's so every ability procs Mandate (it's really good for the ultimate).
After these these two items it's pretty situational (Morello, Zhonya, Demonic Embrace).
I usually like yo build 
For the boots, I usually go lucidity but you can also go Mobis or whatever you want (I enjoy more CDR for his E CD that doesn't scale with levels).
I like to finish the build with Cosmic Drive for extra CDR and MS. 
I feel like this build is pretty situational, but it works pretty well!
I haven't tested any variants yet (maybe going Guardian runes or building locket or moonstone depending, on matchups) but I think this is a pretty solid build.

**Introduction:**
-
 Hey guys, I've been a Gwen One Trick since she came out. [My op.gg]
(https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Number+1+Gwen+NA). I loved her design and kit and have played her every game possible since she came out. I'm just about to hit 100k mastery points on her. In ranked I have 75 wins, and 62 losses with her (55% WR). These games are probably split around 50% top, 35% Jungle, 10% Bot, 5% Mid. I'm only in Gold though so this is entirely aimed towards low elo League. 


-
**TLDR:** 
-
I think Gwen is an incredibly good champ but she is very hard to play from behind. She has a lot of good matchups in top, and can power farm as well as anyone in the jungle. She is extremely reliant on her ult to do much of anything and very reliant on her W as well, meaning she has very clear windows of when she can and can't fight. She is a very strong champion with very defined ways to beat her. Gwen is a champ that only gets better as the game goes on, and if allowed to scale, can carry a whole game. Good players will know her weaknesses and exploit them too easily for her to be relevant in high elo. And I doubt she is picked in pro play due to her lack of team comp synergy as a top laner who can't solo tank or engage, but I think she will excel in lower elo's and unorganized play.


-
**Roles:** 
-


**Top:** She's best in the top lane due to a few reasons though. She has very good matchups in the top lane because the most common champs you see in top are tanks, and gwen shreds tanks at all phases of the game. She also is one of the fastest split pushers in the game, as well as one of the best duelists in the game. Meaning that if Gwen in splitpushing the other team usually has to commit 2 or more people. 


**Jungle:** I like her in the jungle but I recognize that this is more reflective of my elo. She has insane clear speeds at all phases of the game, and at every elo under diamond, will most likely be allowed to power farm herself into a lead. If the other team does not invade you or take advantage of her weak levels 3-5, she will quickly be up in gold on everyone in the game. The issue with Gwen jungle is that she has very bad ganks pre level 6 or if her ult is on CD. This means that enemy laners can be very aggressive for the first 5 minutes of the game because your ganks aren't scary unless you have your ultimate. And even once Gwen hits level 6, her ult is on a 120 second CD meaning that she can practically only gank every 2 minutes.


**Bot:** This is very off meta and I only do it under certain conditions, but Gwen can absolutely steamroll the Bot Lane. The catch is that I only do this when I'm duo queued with my friend who is a Yummi OTP. Yummi negates every single one of Gwen's weaknesses and amplifies her strengths, their kits synergize perfectly. If you have a friend that's willing to play Yummi, I strongly suggest trying this lane out. Give up cs early and farm safely until level 6. Once you're both level 6, it is a free double kill on cooldown with your ults against most bot lanes.


**Mid:** Personally I hate playing Gwen mid and stopped doing so after trying it ~10 times. She is a good counter to lane bully mids like irelia, yasuo, and yone, but gets outranged and poked too much by most mage mids. Most mages in mid can keep their distance from you way too easily, and if the player is somewhat capable, they'll just poke you out of lane every time your W is on CD. Gwen doesn't have any hard cc or far movement ability so her main way on engaging on champs is by getting the slow from her ult and running them down with her E dashes and reapplying the ult slows. Because mid is a lot shorter than top or bot lane, there is a lot less room to run your target down and actually do your damage. 


-
**The rest of this post is strictly talking about top lane Gwen and playing her Top.**
-


-
**Runes:**
-
 The only two runes I ever take on Gwen is Conquerer, or Grasp. I think that Conquerer is her best choice, but certain matchups require Grasp to make it through the early game. Whether I take Conq or Grasp, my secondary tree is always Domination with Sudden Impact and Ravenous Hunter. And I always take 10% attack speed, 9 Adaptive Force, and Resistance based on my lane matchup. 


**In most matchups I take conquerer** as it gives Gwen everything she wants out of a Keystone. She stacks it very fast, she utilizes the healing very well, it synergizes well her her mythic (Riftmaker). Conquerer gives Gwen lots of AP and lots of healing late game, but can feel somewhat weak especially before she has her ultimate as it is much harder to stack. When I run conquerer I take Triumph, Legend: Tenacity, and Last Stand. Triumph is my choice in the first tier. Triumph gives Gwen a lot of healing in teamfights and gives her surprise 1 v 2 potential early. Legend: Tenacity is my preferred choice in the second tier. Paired with Merc Treads and her W, this rune makes Gwen extremely hard to lock down and kill in teamfights.  For the third tier I always go Last Stand. It synergizes extremely well with Gwen because her damage is pretty delayed, and usually comes after you have already taken a significant amount of damage. 


**The only two scenarios that I take grasp are bad matchups for Gwen pre 6 or matchups that become unfightable if Gwen doesn't stomp hard early.** Bad Matchups Pre-6 that I take Grasp/Resolve against to survive early lane are Renekton, Darius, Jax, Viego, Volibear, Pantheon, and Sett. Champs That I take Grasp/Resolve against to bully pre-6 are Tryndamere, Yasuo, Yone, and Morde. 


When running Grasp, I take Demolish, Second Wind, and Revitalize. Grasp, Second Wind, and Revitalize, combined with a dorans shield, give practically infinite sustain in lane that makes it possible to farm safely in almost any matchup. This rune page is purely an early game rune page that I only run when the sustain is a necessity in certain matchups. 


-
**Summoner Spells:**
-
 I always take flash and ignite. Every matchup, every game. Gwen is a super snowbally champ so winning levels 1-5 is extremely important on her. Against champs that she should beat in lane, it's just added kill pressure to help you snowball. And against losing lanes it helps give some early game pressure to deter them from all-inning you.


-
**Items:** 
-
This is where I am somewhat different from most Gwens I see. I have a unique early game approach and a different late game build then the ""consensus"" Gwen build. 

I start every game with a doran's shield and a potion, the sustain that comes with the doran's shield is needed for Gwen's aggressive levels 1-2. 

I always aim for my first back to be at least around 900 gold, but a perfect first back is around 1250 Gold. In most games my first back is a bramble vest and a control/pots. Gwen doesn't do much with AP early game, so a first back bramble vest basically wins lane against matchups like Mundo, Gangplank, Irelia, Viego, and so many more. 

After an early bramble vest (if applicable), I always go Nashors > Tank Boots > Riftmaker.  That is your core item set and when Gwen ""spikes"". Gwen will have around 200 ap, 100-150 armor, ~2000 health,tons of self healing and crazy attack speed and magic dmg on hit with her E's 100% uptime. 

That three item core is relatively normal, but afterwards I usually build full tank which is where my Gwen build is a lot different from others. I usually go for Dead Man's Plate or Force of Nature 4th and 5th item (Depends on Team Comp). And my 6th item is either Thornmail or Spirit Visage, but most games don't go that long anyways.


Gwen has one of the highest base armors and armor growths in the entire game, so building an early bramble vest makes her pretty much impossible to kill to most AD top laners. With the core set of Bramble Vest, Nashor's, Tank Boots, and Riftmaker, Gwen will still do more than enough damage but also be tanky enough to play like a bruiser/front line. As she carries into the late game I build her into an actual bruiser/tank. I don't like going full damage because it makes her too reliant on her W to not instantly die in fights. With Just Nashors and Riftmaker, into full tank, Gwen will still kill squishies in ~2 seconds and be able to shred tanks, while also being unkillable due to her tankiness, healing, W Ability, and 30-60% Tenacity (Depending on Merc Treads or Not)


-
**Matchups:**
-
 Gwen has very distinct winning vs losing matchups, and knowing whether I'm at an advantage or disadvantage in the matchup determines how I play. I think this is far more important on Gwen than other champs such as Darius or Chogath. She has many lane matchups that she can bully and 1 v 1 at any stage in the game if she is even or ahead. But she also has matchups that do the same to her, and require a misplay by the enemy to win the lane. Throughout all my games with Gwen the only matchups that felt truly unwinnable were Tryndamere, Fiora, Pantheon. These are three champions that are by far the hardest lanes with Gwen. 


**Tryndamere** is one of the select few champs that can actually 1 v 1 Gwen at any stage in the game. He is strong enough early to stay in lane and even trade back often, and once you guys are level 6 he is impossible to fight. Gwen lacks the tools to stop tryndamere from killing her when he pops his ult. Because Gwen does all her damage from melee range that means tryndamere can damage you too, and Gwen will burst Tryndamere much faster than he'll burst her but after he pops ult, Gwen has no way to reliably disengage from him. She doesn't have enough mobility to escape him and she has no hard CC to lock him down while he's in ult. He has been my ban as he is the most commonly played out of the three.


**Fiora** and Gwen are actually very similar champions IMO, but Fiora does more single target damage, and Gwen does way more AoE damage. Fiora basically beats Gwen in every way, except in teamfights IMO. In lane Fiora has more range and better poke than Gwen, She has more sustain, and she still wins all ins Pre-6 AND Post-6. I just try and farm through the whole early-mid game in this matchup as Gwen can have more impact in Teamfights and split pushing.


**Pantheon** was the most oppresive lane to play against as Gwen. In laning phase he will continually freeze the wave and all in you at every chance he gets because he can. With pantheons combo of W > Q > E, he can do at least a quarter of your health and you can't even trade back as gwen. Not only that, but Gwen's W doesn't block anything in pantheon's kit other than a long range spear throw, meaning that your W in lane is basically 100 mana to get 20 armor for 5 seconds (USELESS). Because you need stacks on your Q to do any damage, once he freezes you from wave, it's impossible to ever get back near because he will jump on you when you don't even have the stacks to trade back. I have PTSD from these matchups but luckily pantheon top has een seeing a very low pick rate.


-
**Laning:** 
-
Against Melees, Gwen has a very simple trading pattern in lane. You stack full stacks (4) on her Q, and when within range, you dash (E) at the enemy laner and immediately Q while dashing. Make sure to auto attack them once right as your Q finishes, then you disengage. You can do this on a very short cooldown without putting yourself in danger to make it impossible for the enemy laner to get CS without getting harassed. This short E > Q trade actually outranges most melee top laners and creates a trade that is impossible for most champs to match. 


When you have your ult, you can duel pretty much any champ in the game (besides tryndamere and fiora) if you play it right. It's extremely important that you're aware of your Ult CD and your W CD, because starting a fight without either of those can be a death sentence. If your opponents are smart, they'll try to bully you when your ult is down but you just have to take it and wait for your Ult.


-
**Teamfights:** 
-
This is where a lot of people are struggling to find use with Gwen, but I think she excels in teamfights much more than top lane duelists like Fiora or Irelia. I play Gwen like an offtank/bruiser and by the time we are team fighting, I'm usually very tanky. 

Gwen is a terrible engage so I'm never the first one to start a fight, but I am always ready to dive in the second either team engages. 

Once the fight starts my first priority is finding out of position enemies. If there is an enemy squishy even a few steps away from their team, Gwen can dash on them and pop her W to ensure that she essentially gets to 1 v 1 that champ (Which she wins almost all of). 

If there is no out of position enemies and the fight is generally front to back, such as a dragon fight, I will actually go in right behind my tank and focus the enemy team's tank. Gwen is an absolute tank shredder, and heals for damage that's based on max health % damage. If Gwen starts shredding the tank with 2 autos per second and pops her W to block damage from enemy backline, she can quickly remove an enemy tank from the fight while taking virtually no damage.


In teamfights her Ult usage is very important because it is her most useful survival tool. **It's best to save Gwen's Ult for any of these 3 things:** 

1. To chase enemies after a fight 

2. To disengage a losing fight 

3. To Heal Yourself. 

The absolute worst thing you can do on Gwen is start a fight by blowing all three casts of your Ult to use as damage. It's best to save your Ult until you've taken lots of damage or there is a group of enemies. If multiple casts of your Ult hit 3 or more enemies, or just 1 or 2 tanks, Gwen will heal all of her health. Late game her ult does around 45% Max health damage through her passive if you hit every cast , and heals for 70% of that damage with just your passive. If you do 45% max health to multiple enemies and heal for most of that damage, Gwen can basically full heal on command.


-
**Conclusion:**
-
 I think Gwen is an interesting champ as she is an AP Top Lane Hypercarry/Bruiser Hybrid. She has lots of outplay potential for both the person playing her and the people playing against her. I think that she is one of the healthiest releases in a long time, and is no need of a buff or nerf. She can't be blind picked and win every lane, but she can be blind picked and be fine against almost any matchup. She counters certain champs (Tanks) and is countered by certain champs (Stronger Duelists), and I think she's generally very balanced.

If you want to look at replay, everything started when he died for the 3rd time towerdived at min 13.

When he revived, he started to take all my camps, I pinged to stop while I was going to drake with the team, he continued to farm my camp (without helping on drake of course) and then he went top to fight (and die again! min 15) vs malzahar.Since I haven't helped his lane so far and he lost a tower I ignored that because he needed to farm to come back, but then the shit happened: he reached me while I was doing red, and since that moment he became literally my nasty pet, trying to steal everything he could, pissing me whole time, using his leap, Teleport or flash to gap close when I used E to jump away from him, or roots to split our ways, etc... and when I went in fights he was just watching.

Here today bringing up some new adjustments to the rules for the subreddit as well as an announcement of our newest mod team members!

Rules to start

**1. Requiring proof for champion standing posts**

Rule will now be enforced as:

> All posts about champion win-rates or play statistics must include correlating evidence by either a link to the website they're referencing, or an image of said stat they are quoting on a aggregate website (op.gg, u.gg, champion.gg, etc).

We've updated this rule as we've noticed an uptick of users quoting statistics that don't always match up with any known data aggregate website. Having the basis for this data is extremely helpful in giving clarity to the conversation and makes sure to avoid people quoting numbers in the future off of sketchy data or hearsay.

**2. Bug reports must provide proof of bug and provide what patch this first occurred**

Rule will now be enforced as:
>All posts about bug reports must include an example of the bug, and the patch in which this bug first occurred.

Much like the previous rule added, having vague descriptions of a bug in game makes it incredibly difficult to pin down for anyone looking to try and figure out the issue. As such, we're simply asking for users now to add a video or picture sample of the bug, as well as the first patch of occurrence. 

**3. Wild Rift and its future on the subreddit**

The [relevance rule regarding other Riot games](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/otherriotgames) will now be updated to match LoR  - ""lore allowed""

> Disallow all Wild Rift specific content. Content comparing Wild Rift to league of legends and lore content on the shared universe is allowed.

Due to Wild Rift opening up to most regions, and the fact that it is clearly diverging from the normal League of Legends content, we're now asking for users to move Wild Rift content to /r/wildrift, as this content will no longer be allowed here. Much like Legends of Runeterra however, we will continue to allow lore content that is released for the Runeterran universe to be allowed on League of Legends as the lore is relevant through all parts of League.

gx1fs,untamedlazyeye,"As per our [original announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/mz9nec/announcing_prediction_tournaments_msi_edition/) we are trialing the new prediction tournaments feature reddit is releasing! We saw your feedback on the trial so far, and this led to us [canceling it for group stage](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/n7tfsp/were_cancelling_msi_predictions_for_groups_stage/). However, we are happy to announce the feature is returning for the Rumble and Knockout Stages. 

This time, it is being run somewhat different. 

* The predictions will be hosted on r/leaguepredictions, not /r/leagueoflegends 
* Comments on r/leaguepredictions will be disabled. 
* A megathread will be created on /r/leagueoflegends that will link you to the predictions. This is where you will be able to comment on them. 

Our hope is that this change will resolve the primary issue we saw, mainly that predictions were flooding the front page and drowning out other content. With this, everything will either be hosted off the main subreddit, or confined to a megathread. Beyond that, it will work much the same as it did before. That means that Friday's predictions would be resolved Saturday at the start of match day. 

Additionally, some users blocked u/molediver due to the spam. With this change, we ask that you unblock them. [This link](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035252-How-do-I-unblock-someone-) will give you the info on how to do that. 

In the future, we expect it to be possible to host these events on our subreddit without the flooding issue, as reddit is actively working on resolving that. 

Head on over to r/leaguepredictions to start voting now!

Good luck everyone, and may the upsets not doom you!",2021-05-13 22:59:54,126.0,nbilox

**Tank legendary item options** - both reducing the near mandatory status of Thornmail but also boosting a bunch of underused items like Frozen Heart and Warmogs

**Reducing Systemic Mobility**- A new project that we're ramping up. This is going to be both addressing major mobility outliers that go too far breaking intended weaknesses (like Stridebreaker) and trimming lots of small movement speed creep across items and runes. These aren't meant to be nerfs, just power shifts away from too much mobility. A champion focused pass may come after, but we want to see the systems changes play out first.

**Tahm Kench** - Still in the works, art and final tuning are progressing nicely

**Top agency and Split Pushing**- Continuing the work to increase top lane agency and the viability of split pushing. Currently we have a split push focused fighter item, a split push focused tank item, and some adjustments to outer turrets to make them a bit more valuable

**Sona** - Design direction of the Sona changes is locked, but we won't get her art done until after Tahm Kench is done

But for an early surrender to work it has  to be unanimous, why does it have to be? if 3/4 people want the game to end, why should those 3 people have to be held hostage in a 4v5 just because 1 person wants to play it out.

This experience of 1 person consantly saying no in a 4v5 literally leads to toxicity. Because you know what I'm most likely going to do in that situation? I'm just going to farm until the game finally ends, I'm not trying in a hopeless 4v5 just because 1 person out of everybody doesn't want the game to end. I just don't understand why when the majority of people want the game to end, it won't just because it must be a unanimous decision.

This also gives a lot of power to that 1 person since they can troll and keep saying no even though they know they're not going to win and I'm sure we've all had an experience like that.

5 years ago i managed to get challenger playing only nunu.

Ever since the rework i refused to touch that champion so i had to find another champion to dedicate my time into.

&#x200B;

Turned out i was pretty decent on sejuani so...  ...there we go.

Considering that I'm pretty old already and doubted if i should continue playing league i started a challenge on my stream.

Either i would make challenger just playing sejuani or i would quit League of Legends.

During this challenge i put up a subscriber goal that i would cosplay sejuani if i would make that goal.

Not thinking i would ever make it i was just chilling on sejuani climbing the ladders.

Twitch chat isn't twitch chat if they did weird things, but i reached my goal within a few days LOL.

Not knowing anything about cosplay i started gathering things for it and trust me: cosplay takes ALOT of work and dedication.

While preparing my cosplay i kept climbing and reached 611LP grandmaster (570\~ was enough for challenger)

The idiot that i am i kept playing and dropped some LP before 1AM when players get promoted to challenger.

So yeah just ''virtual'' challenger it is for me.

Long story short here is the cosplay that i made ENJOY!

Usually Riot adds a list of spells that can be used in any gamemode and that gives a hit on where it will be played. But this time we only have this.. so I don't know what it's going to be or if it's going to be played in SR, we gotta wait  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Here are Riot rules about Victorious champion selection:

&#x200B;

1. **No repeat:** Champs who already have a Victorious, Championship, or Conqueror skin won't get it.
2. **No repeat 2, role version:** If the last year victorious was a mid laner, this year won't.
3. **The champion must not have another skin coming out soon.** Riot prefers spread the champion pool instead of dropping several skins for only one champ.
4. **No small amount of skins**. If the champion has a Winrate/pickrate of 99,99999999% however has 1 or 2 skins: good bye chances. Best example: Rell.
5. **No incoming big balance changes.** Translation: No Udyr.

drm6o,phylaris,"One of the biggest misunderstandings I'm seeing regarding the new catchup EXP system is how average game level is calculated.  Catchup EXP only kicks in when a jungler is 2 levels under the average game level, and the bonus EXP increases by intervals of 50 for each level discrepancy.

Most players assume (understandably) that League follows a normal rounding system, and something like an average game level of 4.1 will round down to 4.  However, the system *always* rounds up.  So if you're level 3 and the average game level is 4.1, for example, you'll actually be within the 2 level minimum deficit for catchup EXP, as the average game level is actually 5.

Unless Kindred is doing it on purpose, of course, which would explain a lot of shit. 

Like, even if Olaf was to die in battle fighting an impossibly strong opponent like Aatrox for example (which is what Olaf wants btw, that's why he keeps throwing himself at fucking Krakens and shit and coming out alive as he is simply too big of a fucking chonker to die), they'd probably just bring him back just so he could go back to his house and get depression or something. Maybe Lamb is just some sort of psychopath who wants to see people suffer for as long as possible, whereas Wolf, who is depicted as some sort of aggressor who wants to kill everything is actually the merciful one in the relationship who will actually just take people to the other side whenever their time comes providing them the release of death, whereas Lamb wants them alive for as long as possible, so she can seem then wither away and suffer for the sin of their mortality.",2021-05-13 07:23:15,439.0,nb2h8g

Is it just me or did the prestige skins get worse every year?

changed the character model, changed the dog of his ult gave him a crown and made his trident look like its made out of diamonds, animations have something special and recolored everything.
there are a lot more examples.. quiyana, irelia, ahri, senna... you get my point, all of these skins look special...like a prestige version of their normal skin with sepcial features on the caracter model.
back in 2019 they made skins which looked actually prestige, they've put work into these skins and they turned out so good.
in 2020 they didn't put that same effort into these skins imo. Sett, zoe, soraka, yasuo...they made small changes and painted them golden there is really not more to it.

now in 2021 with the releases of lulu and sylas the prestige skins are nothing more then a yellow/white chroma of the base version of the skin.
nothing special anymore. It kinda feels like the prestige skins lost their touch... Don't get me wrong the skins look still very nice but they don't feel prestige anymore...

Barrier: Increase shield amount by 20  


Cleanse:  Increases the duration of the crowd control reduction by 1 second for a total of 4 seconds.  


Heal:  Passively grants 5 − 90 (based on level) maximum health.  


Smite:  Grants 10 bonus gold per use.

More Examples:

 • Ionia vs Noxus (champs) 
 
 • ""Couples Aram"" Only 2v2

 • Only stealth champs

 • Hexakill 6v6

 • Start with 40% cdr

 • 3v3 SR

 • Only juggernauts etc

 • Only champs from one region e.g Ionia

 • Start game with e.g 6k and lvl 6

 • No hard CC champs 

 • Fire vs Water (nation) Fire/Water champs. Includes champs with Fire/Water skins(made available), can pick no other skin e.g infernal, high noon, winter wonder etc. Provides an aesthetically pleasing experience and allows a ""fantasy"" to be lived bla bla bla

12pfc1,numbers909,"This is pure theory crafting nonsense, but I have come up with this:

|Top|Ornn|
|:-|:-|
|Jungle|Morgana|
|Mid|Malzahar|
|ADC|Yasuo|
|Support|Neeko|

It could use some optimization to maximize the potential of the combo. Nevertheless, here it is.

Ornn has his unique ""Brittle"" passive that reduces tenacity by 30% (I don't know how exactly Brittle extends CC, so for the sake of simplicity I'll just throw on 30% to the duration). Yasuo has a knockup, and his R is a knockup extension which synergizes nicely with Ornn. Morgana is essentially CC incarnate. Malzahar only has one CC and that is his R, but it's 2.5 seconds long and is essential to get his teammates' CC abilities time to cool down. Neeko has both her R for stun and E for a root.

Malzahar, Morgana, and Neeko will build Everfrost. The rest of their items will be CDR/Ability Haste. Morgana should have blue buff. Yasuo can build whatever he wants, we only really need him for the Q2 and R knockup. Ornn is similar, he will just go his typical build.

Now we begin.

* Ornn engages our victim with Q-R-E-R2-W combo. Depending on the execution of the combo we can get a solid **3 seconds** of airborne here.
* Morgana syncs her Q with Ornn's W. Brittle extends Morgana's 3 seconds to **3.9 seconds**. Brittle is consumed, Morgana starts R.
* Morgana pops Everfrost just as the root on Q ends, giving **1.5 seconds** after which Q should be off cooldown. Morgana Qs again, and R detonates. **4.5 seconds** of a root and stun.
* Now that Morgana is down an R and Q, Malzahar comes in with his R. **2.5 seconds**.
* Ornn uses W to apply brittle as Malzahar's ult ends.
* Morgana lands a Q, and consumes Brittle. **3.9 seconds**.
* Neeko uses Everfrost. **1.5 seconds.**
* Assuming Neeko has minions to empower E off of, the empowered E will land with **3 seconds** onto the CC chain. This is when she starts her R, and lands the **1.25 seconds** of stun.
* Morgana may land her Q again. **3 seconds**.
* Neeko may land her E. **3 seconds**.
* Ornn lands his Q-W-E combo. **1 second** of airborne.
* Yasuo would have stacked his Q2, and just as the victim lands after Ornn's CC he will use Q2 and R at the last second. I would give this **1.8 seconds** of CC.
* Morgana may land her Q again. **3 seconds**.

Now for some math. **3 + 3.9 + 1.5 + 4.5 + 2.5 + 3.9 + 1.5 + 3 +1.25 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1.8 + 3** comes out to:

# 36.85 seconds where the victim literally cannot move

Now as I was writing this, I realized it was possible to indefinitely chain Morgana Q and empowered Neeko E. But then I would have to consider mana costs and how many of them can be thrown out before they literally can't cast them anymore because they don't have the mana. Unfortunately, I'm lazy. But it's a possibility.

I would love to see what you guys can come up with, or if I should swap out some champs to make this *even longer.*",2021-05-13 01:20:54,339.0,nau4t8
b08s0,YupNope66,"Hey all!

It's always interesting seeing how much players practice during international events so I took a look at TrackingThePros to find their Riot-account summoner names and used the calendar on Mobalytics profiles to track how much the attendees were playing solo queue from April 26 (when they started arriving) to May 11 (last day of Group Stage).

Of course, this doesn't give the full picture as players prep in other ways like scrimming or watching VODs but it's fun seeing who the grindlords are and seeing weird stuff like Beryl playing mostly Jungle.



*Note: MAD were a bit tricky since they're from EU and didn't seem to be using their Riot accounts as much. If you know their mains + smurfs let me know and I'll adjust their counts (I was able to find some of them).*

7ts8agan,Parentheti,"Hello, all. 

I have a friend who played LoL back in S4/5 and is recently getting back into the game but lost his password and associated email address. So unfortunately, we've played a few games at an MMR much lower than either of us are used to.

Now queueing with randos is difficult for its own reasons at this MMR because there are likely 2+ people on your own team who are actually, genuinely just now getting into the game. It's been fun teaching people new things, but I've run into an issue that I think should be addressed.

There's a sweet spot between level 1 and level 9 where you ARE NOT allowed to play jungle or have any custom runes. I get it, because JG is a complex role and runes are their own nightmare until you know how the game actually works. The issue is, you can face people who DO have access to these important advances if you find yourself doing really well your first few games.

I reckon it's something like this: You can't use JG items, smite, or runes until level 9 because it would be a tad unfair to other new players when a smurf actually *does* use them effectively. The issue is, it's generally accepted that you shouldn't have more than one person in any given lane except bot, so you may well be forced to play JG (or ineffectively roam from lane to lane) against a higher-level player, (or smurf) who CAN effectively jg and use custom runes.

It may be to keep noobs from feeling bad about themselves or thinking that JG is just ineffective or unnecessary due to a few learning games, but it's *more effective* at discouraging noobs from trying to learn JG at all (and trust me, it shows in higher ranks-- bronze and silver especially).",2021-05-13 22:52:43,7.0,nbigbu

y1y019a,Xplosion101,"Hello there,

recently, I noticed that there is a major translation error in the Greek version of League. Now, I know that most of you probably don't care as this is a very niche issue due to the language, however I feel it is the only way to raise awareness on the matter. 

During the last days of patch 11.8, I sent a ticket to my local department of Riot Support so that I could notify them about the issue. Now, two patches later, the issue still hasn't been fixed, which is kind of disappointing considering it is just a single string, albeit one with great importance to the game.

**So, what is this translation error?**

As you may know, Riot recently revamped the in-game tooltips for abilities to make them look the same in terms of how stats etc. are displayed. When applying this change to the greek version of League, the translation team also had to translate the word ""ασπίδα"" (**shield**). And for some reason, they opted for the word ""θωράκιση"", which does not mean shield, but **armor**, and it is also the word used for the in-game stat called armor too! As such, now two very different things have the same translation, and this is really problematic, especially for new players. For example, Riven's E now reads ""Riven dashes forward and gains \[X\] armor"" instead of ""gets a shield that absorbs \[X\] damage"", which is incorrect. Nunu's Ult also mentions him getting ""armor"" instead of a ""shield"", which was not the case before the tooltip revamp. This can lead to confusion and needs to be fixed.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.",2021-05-12 19:14:37,864.0,nam6fw

So I've been high elo on EUW since season 3 and most of my 9 years of playing have been interspersed with frequently burning out from the game, in a variety of ways.

So let me know what things you do to stop yourself from Burning Out or why it is you still play league after all these years!

sh6y7,Baloth," i should explain how rappel works just in case i guess. if you target the ground with e (smart cast on) you will either go up in the air and wait for up to 2 seconds in which you have time to choose an enemy or ward or plant to land on or you will fall back into the middle or rappels radius, or move close enough to that spot first if it was too far away, and then do the same thing, or alternatively, you can hover over a target and press e and it will immediately \[if in range, otherwise it will run into range first\] rappel you up, then down onto said target without delay. generally rappel will land you on the opposite side of the target you were on previous to the rappel cast. 

i have 900k some mastery on elise i only mention this in hopes it dispels some doubt its user error tho its always possible i guess. this issue has been happening for years, but didnt always happen, some change in the game made this start happening, or some issue with my pc/settings maybe? but doubtful its an issue with my pc, bc its happened many times now on 2 different pcs ive owned.

specifically, what ends up happening a lot, is when im a dire situation on elise, and im trying to rapidly get away with rappel, i quickly target a creep who are far away from the champions, so that i can get some space, but somehow, the game decides to rappel down on enemy champions, who would often times be a half a screen away from where i actually targeted, sometimes even the exact opposite side of rappels entire radius, which is almost a full screen. im not sure what the issue is, but it seems to only happen when i move the mouse really fast, (i used to be a really good cs go player, and i only bring this up to explain i move the mouse really quickly, but also really accurately) so im not sure if this is a registry issue, or if riot just has the game coded to assume i made a mistake if i move the mouse ""too quickly"" and targets a champion instead of a creep... or what?

i vaguely remember there being some implementation of targeting champions over creeps automatically added whether you want it on or not, but i could be wrong (and i do know this used to be a togglable setting that has been removed). i really hope thats not the case as im just gunna regularly get screwed over and die when i shouldnt like 20+% of the time and not be able to do anything about it xept try to get myself to slow down, which is just dumb - im not making a mistake, stop making the game think it knows better than the player targeting the thing... dangit

this is super frustrating. i also know for a fact its not a misclicking issue. if it were i would have noticed that by now with how many times this has happened, and most of the time im absolutely sure i clicked something far, far away from where it landed me, nor am i not always getting dropped in the middle due to time out and sometimes will in fact again be on the exact opposite side of the radius i chose, bc the enemy champion was over there. what does always happen when this issue happens, is i drop down on an enemy champion, which is what makes me think this is riot thinking they know better than the player what they wanted to do",2021-05-13 09:09:36,32.0,nb4opt

These ones can benefit from the first non keystone row of inspiration (hexflash, free boots, free stopwatch) in some way without feeling like it's directly working against you (delaying steelcaps into ad matchups), feeling like it's literally useless toplane (hexflash) or like it comes way too late for it to matter before laning phase is decided (stopwatch)

It might be a really bad unbalanced suggestion but what if you could pick 3/2 (primary/secondary) runes from any row you wanted considering it's the inspiration tree which literally is defined as ""Creative tools and rule bending""?

nhswe,Newfiero,"A bit more in depth of what I've experienced a lot is that I'll have games where my team will either be plain toxic or grief our team in some way, shape or form, and I'll take time to un-tilt and then requeue for a win. Eventually after a long line of potentially unsportsmanlike games, I'll get that almost flawless win for myself and my team and we will walk out feeling good about the performance we just put on together.

However, there is one thing that just kills my happiness and it's seeing I was invited to do a survey from Riot. 

The surveys always seem to talk about behavior of the game I was just in, completely disregarding the past 4 games I played where I had to take a break from the game afterwards out of fear of queuing with those toxic teammates again. The options are only to say something poor about my most recent team, or say there is no toxic behavior taking place in my games.

Obviously, this feels really weighted and for too well timed by Riot when they give me these surveys. Why do I only receive them on wins, and why is it always the specific game and not ""In the past 5 games"" or something more broad to work with. Does anyone else feel like they aren't actually looking to hear if there is a problem with their system? It doesn't feel like they are at all concerned about my experience as a player which is why these questionnaires pop up at such consistent times; right after a win. I just wanted to know if anyone else has noticed this as I do because it feels like Riot doesn't actually care but want to give off the impression they do.",2021-05-14 02:27:20,0.0,nbnkzw

Today, we finally launched our Version 3, the main improvements are: slicker interface, better data, new recommended items/runes/ability order and a jungle-specific stats table (did you know Darius currently secures the first dragon the most?).

We would love to get as much feedback as possible on the site so we know what to focus on, so please let us know your thoughts below.

The site is run by a community of Redditors and we're always looking for more people to join and help us develop the site, whether that's coding, design, social media or just people to brainstorm with!

5duzkvbp,Hide_yo_chest,"Due to the success of consecutive “alternate reality” skin lines, starting with Project Mordekaiser’s 2021 Cyberpunk City ult, Riot has made one too many portal functions for legendary skins. Players, in an attempt to overload the servers and free the human population from League’s villainous mind control, select a full team of Project skins and band together to ult at the same time, quintupling the strain placed on the servers and causing multiple nuclear equivalent explosions from the city sized server bases put in place by state mandated LoL upkeep installed by corrupted corporate backing politicians paid off by the success of Riot’s Katarina-wifu cloning facilities and accompanying cat-girl chroma packs. 

In retaliation, Riot sends their edgy elite known as the “Security Team” to threaten the rebellion with their signature “10,000 law suit slash” technique. The rebels suffered heavy casualties and are forced to hide in renovated Twisted Treeline server facilities, the one place Riot doesn’t dare touch due to the $3 they would have to spend to upkeep the server.

qst8f,Azurealy,"Hey all you challenger-level players I'm going to keep this short.  11.10 saw buffs to Rageblade reducing its cost from 2800 to 2600. before that it  gained the ability to be affected by crit strike damage modifiers in 11.5(but you couldn't buy IE with it so idk what that would be), and it received a 5% Attack speed increase on 11.4. That is all the changes it has seen in season 11. 3 buffs. and yet it still not bought all of that much. Why not though? at 2800 it was a little cheaper than most and now it's 2600 and it still isn't a great item to pick up. it is so cheap now, so what's the deal? The problem with rageblade is that the more crit you have, the worse it gets, and every item has crit now. So what this means is that if you buy rageblade, as the game goes on, you will become weaker and weaker than the same you who bought anything else.

&#x200B;

Let's look at some numbers. Here I used a champion who should love the current rageblade, Vayne, and I built in a way to try and give advantages to the rageblade, I used PtA and attack speed runes. I did tests at 3, 4, and 5 items (plus boots). The baseline at 3 is Kraken slayer and BoRK + Comparative items. So all builds have the base, and added items have the items built beforehand so at 3 it has the base, plus RageBlade but at 4 ill just say base+RB+\[item\]+\[item\]. I took measurements for both total damage and DPS and you'll see that reflected here. For DPS I took averages because crit chance could affect things and for every instance, I waited for BoRK to be completely reset. I picked Blood Thirster for RB second item to compete AD and gold wise with IE. I couldn't think of any other item I could do and if I could buy IE I would have. Everything was done on level 18 vayne for consistency.

|Build|5 autos|10 autos|20 autos|DPS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|base+rageblade|2595|5096|9990|1200|
|base+Phantom Dancer|2388|4259|9046|1100|
|Base+RB+Blood Thirster|3521|6414|12646|1600|
|base+PD+Infinity Edge|3912|7140|14552|1750|
|base+RB+Mortal Reminder|3632|7366|14542|1900|
|base+PD+IE+Mortal Reminder|3796|8477|17262|2100|

Here you will be able to see that as the game went on, having built RageBlade will put you at a disadvantage over building PD and IE. Phantom Dancer is the same cost as Rageblade yet phantom dancer will allow you to scale harder than the ""scale harder"" item. one thing to note though is that having just the base and comparing PD to RB, you'll find slightly more damage with RB and that could be worth if you're looking to end the game at 3 items.

&#x200B;

While writing this, I began to wonder the difference between just RB and PD as second item. so I jumped back into practice tool and tested.

|Build|20autos|DPS|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Kraken+RB|8509|798|
|Kraken+PD|7968|752|

So here we can see that building RB first is actually a little better. I mostly wanted to go back and test this when I saw that the base + RB was slightly stronger. So in conclusion; RB is a better early item, despite the connotation that it is a late game scaling.",2021-05-14 01:50:07,0.0,nbmocc

Those have been nerfed to a point where they act better as sustain rather than healing in fight. They dont require you to buy anti healing. The only 2 items that can be considered are moonstone (which nobody uses now) and goredrinker (after the Buff) as ""anti healing required"". 

It just makes me mad the ""you always need anti healing"" just because a champion has conqueror. 

This case is specifically annoying in the top lane for people justifying bramble doesn't need a Nerf because all champs in top lane heal. Like literally, it is good on stuff like fiora and aatrox because of the anti healing. It is good onto Irelia as well because Irelia uses pretty well vamp scepter. But then who else? What AD champion heals of hitting the opponent?

And what it is the craziest thing is, they are saying that when last season meta was even more disgusting. Conqueror healed more, ravenous Hunter wasn't nerfed yet, ravenous hydra had 18% LIFESTEAL, DEATHS DANCE EXISTED, bloodline healed more, and there was no 60% GW.

8duzz2fe,Handle_Much,"Hello all,

For some reason I cannot fathom, I got inspired to share my story. Hopefully it can help that someone have their break through this season to get to their dream tier.

Background

I first started with Dota when I was 15. Started league since Season 2. I love watching competitive league (SKT fan since season 3). Got married last year. Finally decided this season will be my final season. Finally decided to join the solo que grind seriously to see how far I will get. Most I have gotten was D5 in S6-7. Although in those days, I cant say I was trying really hard. Still, I had ~300-400 games per season, so I wasnt not trying either.

How it started

A friend of mine reached D5 last season. I always felt I was so much better than him. He didnt think so. I needed to prove myself. Then I got married last year. I have more personal responsibility. My ego felt I needed to prove myself for some reason. So I began my climb.

From Gold to Platinum - WR ~55%

This was arguablt my most difficult clumb. I do think there is negligible mechanical differences between Gold players and low Diamond players. I started as a Support main only playing Thresh. I would dominate lanes and even score kills and assists on roams. I would still lose more than 45% of the game. I failed promo three times. I decided to switch role to JG. Massive success. My WR went up to ~70% playing only Elise.

From Platinum to Diamond

My hiccups began around P1. I was scoring early with Elise, but started to not carrying many games any more. I was notably tilted in many games. This is when I decided to mute all. This helped immensely. I also picked up a lot about my macro plays and play making decisions. My WR was ~55% at the end playing almost only Elise.

From D4 to D2

I switched to Top because JG was too stressful. Once I learned how to think and how to macro, the climb was pretty easy with top. My WR was ~65%. However my KDA was down visibly. At D2, I started losing lane massively mechanically. I thought this is probably my limit. Content with what I have done, I decided to call it a day.

Things I have learned
- Mute All: 
I think on average, it helps to mute all. This point has been made by many, so I wont elaborate. Let your team know nicely you muted all before you mute all in team select.
- Play passively and capitalize on others mistake rather than playing to make plays: 
There are just so many mistakes we all make as low elo players. If you capitalize on them even on one or two occasions, you are likely to win the game. Look for opportunity to capitalize on punishing their mistakes. Dont try to force plays. Examples of these are invading with no rationale, pushing lanes excessively, constantly picking battles in lane phase, doing objectives without vision, etc. There are just so many mistakes and all you need is to capture one before the game is too tilted. This means you dont have to trade in lane to get solo kills, aggresively make a difficult gank or roam, look for small window of opportunity. While these are helpful, these have low probability of success and difficult to pull off. Take simple wins and your average winrate goes up. In JG, I decided it makes sense to only make absolutely no brainer ganks (which were so many, not surprisingly). In Top, I never traded but just farmed until the other player made massive mistake. This is why I played Sion and Vlad. The other player would get visibly frustrated and I would score easy ganks for my jg.
- Be content with 60% wr:
This means you lose 4 out of 10. This means you may lose 8 in a row. You have to be okay with this unless you are smurfing.
- Always think macro before you act:
You instinctively gank top after full clear, but did you ask if their jg might be topside? What about their mid? When you engage fights, did you count how many players you have vs how many players they have? These are simple questions but really had to get into habit of asking. You can only improve if you start asking there questions when you play. This is partially why I decided to only go for easy non brainer plays.
- Come up with winning strategy:
With Vlad I told my JG to leave me and focus botside. My strategy was to farm 2 core as safe as possible. I almost never traded and always saved my tp so I can help botside when needed. My strategy was to keep it even until late game.
With elise my strategy was to gank mid after three clear. This almost always gave my mid advantage early which helped with subsequent scuttle fight (NA JGs cant let go scuttle for some reason).
With Sion, i always looked for opportunity to use ult to mid. I tried to clear fast and roam. I opted out of most trades unless the other Top was forcing a unfavorable trade for them.

x8yq0,boocaboo,"# About Cithria

Cithria is a character in Legend of Runeterra and I would love for her to become a champion in League of Legends.

She currently has 4 cards based on her that progressively gets more powerful as she ""ranks up"" being

[Cithria of cloudfield](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/cards/01DE039)

[Vanguard Squire](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/cards/01DE036)

[Cithria the Bold](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/cards/01DE051)

[Cithria, Lady of Clouds](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/en_us/cards/04DE005)

Her first 2 cards are more useful as low cost units to support your board as you begin to develop your hand.

Her later 2 cards are more aggressive as they are used to buff other units for an attack.

So making the champion around this, I want her to be a supportive character that can later become an offensive threat when she ""ranks up"".

&#x200B;

# Champion Concept

Like I said before I want to make her a support that later becomes an offensive threat by ""ranking up"".

To do this I would have her be a form switcher like Nidalee, Jayce, and Elise.

She would have a supportive stance and an offensive stance. But unlike them the cooldown on skills of each form is shared, sort of. Using a skill in one stance will but the other's stance skill on cooldown.

She would later be able to combo a skill of both stances once she maxed the skill.

I have two ideas on how this would be done in her passive or her ultimate.

The first idea would be pretty much like Syndra's passive.

When Cithria fully max rank a skill. Her alternate form's skill will not be set on cooldown.

The second idea would be in her ultimate passive, ranking it up would decrease initial cooldown of stance abilities by 0/2/4 seconds (I going to ignore this idea for the rest of the post)

She also has a [Silverwing](https://lor.mobalytics.gg/cards/01DE004) to aid her in battle

I think it might help more to just dive into her potential abilities

# 

# Abilities

**Keynotes** \- Most of Cithria's skill will scale off both ad and ap. Supportive stance will have higher Ap ratios comparatively. Offensive stance will have higher AD ratios comparatively. This is to make her build orientate around her stances. If you build offensively, you lose supportive power and vice versa.

Supportive buffs must be applied to an allied champion/Silverwing and cannot be applied directly to oneself. This is to keep her in line as a support but if you want to self-buff you must use your Silverwing. Self-buffing is also on a long cooldown as it is tied to the Silverwing's cooldown.

&#x200B;

**Passive** \- **Learning through experience**

Upon using a skill, Citheria's alternate stances' skill also goes on cooldown

Upon maxing a skill, this limitation is removed.

Cithria also ranks up when maxing a skill. (Changes her appearance and voice lines to match her new rank) (ult max does not count as rank up)

&#x200B;

**Q - Rally / Groundbreaker** (9/8/7/6/5 second cd| 4 second cd)

Supportive Stance - Cithria raises her sword encouraging her ally granting them 10/15/20/25/30% bonus movement speed for 5 seconds and makes their next attack/ablilty do 30/60/90/120/150 (+30% AP)(+10% AD) physical damage

Offensive Stance - Cithria slams her sword infront of her dealing damage to all enemies infront of her dealing 90/120/150/180/210 (+30% AP)(+60% AD) and creates a slowing area in place of the attack.

&#x200B;

**W - Silverwing Vanguard / Challenging Strike** (20/18/16/14/12 second cd| 6 second cd)

Supportive Stance - Cithria summons a silverwing to aid her in battle, The silverwing charges foward knocking up enemies in a straight line for 1 second then stays at the end of the dash and attacks nearby enemies.

The Silverwing has a hitbox and can be cc'd during its dash, stopping it in its place. The Silverwing may be buffed by Cithria. The Silverwing has 2/2/3/3/4 (+1 for every 100 ap)(+1 for every 100 bonus AD) hits before death, and deals 5/6/7/8/9% of the target current health in physical damage on hit. The Silverwing only attacks when Cithria auto attacks. It priorities Cithria's target if in range. If not, it will attack the nearest enemy unit prioritizing champions.

Buffing the Silverwing with Rally will increase its dash speed tremendously. Buffing with Protective Barrier will give additional hit points.

Offensive Stance - Cithria next auto attack taunts the enemy for 1 second dealing 10/35/60/85/110 (+20% ap)(+40% AD) additional physical damage. If the Silverwing is out, it will dash towards where the target was initially hit, knocking up enemies for .5 seconds along the way.

&#x200B;

**E - Protective Barrier / Piercing Strike** (12/11/10/9/8 second cd| 5 second cd)

Supportive Stance - Cithria gives a 75/100/125/150/175 (+40% ap)(+20% AD) shield to an ally and herself for 4 seconds. Shielding the Silverwing will give it 1/1/2/2/3 additional hitpoints.

Offensive Stance - Cithria stabs a target for 60/90/120/150/180 (+20% ap)(+50% AD) piercing their armor reducing it by 10/15/20/25/30 flat armor for 3 seconds. If the target is a champion, she heals for 12% of her missing hp.

&#x200B;

**R - Support and Attack** (9/6/3/0 second cd, cd removed at maxed ranked, starts off with 1 point)

Cithria switches stances granting new abilites.

Cithria also gains bonus stats based on her stance.

Supportive Stance - Cithria gains 15/30/45 bonus ap

Offensive Stance - Cithria gains 10/20/30 bonus ad

&#x200B;

# How would she play?

Ideally you want to play her as a support and start most fights with the Supportive Stance. It buffs your allies and since the cooldown on her offensive stances are shorter, you can switch stance for additional cc or damage in long trades. She can protect her allies with Silverwing as it will tank any skill shot thrown at it or use it to disengage with its knock-up. Rally will be her engage too by either rushing with her team and using Silverwing at close proximity or using rally on Silverwing's dash to possibly catch the enemy off. Once she uses her buffs and abilities. She should stick onto the enemy carry with her slows, taunts, and Silverwing. As she does not lack damage when she starts maxing her abilities, she can become a serious threat. Optimal ability max may be W->E->Q

She could also be played as a Laner or Jungler although be it less efficiently. Groundbreaker and Silverwing will be her main source of aoe clear. Laning will be more difficult as you will most likely be in Offensive Stance most of the time. But when Jungling you don't lack CC with Rally/Silverwing/Challenging Strike. A little attack speed doesn't hurt as Silverwing scales off it. With more levels than a support. You should be able to use both abilities from each stance sooner. For Jungling I would max W->Q->E. As for Lanning Q->W->E.

# Itemization

As a support, basic support items into tanks is fine. Moonstone, Locket, Shurelya's, Chemtank would all work.

As for more offensive builds, bruiser items with ability haste is a must. Black Cleaver will be core. As for mystics Trinity Force, Stride Breaker, Goredrinker, Divine Sunderer are good.

&#x200B;

# Additional Notes

Maybe she can have lines upon maxing abilities that indicate her status like, ""Vanguard Squire, Cithria, reporting for duty."" ""Follow me! Cithria, the Bold"" ""Lady of Clouds, Cithria, ready for your next command."" idk

This was created for fun, so don't expect anything.

Stats and ability ratios were all created on a whim without too much thought put in them.

I like to theory craft nutty builds but normal games rarely make it past 3 items

But it's cool to think about.

If we think about it from an overflow perspective maybe health/energy regen doesn't do much, it makes sense that there are hard caps for them. 

Mana Regen though, you're drawing magical energy from outside sources (theoretically, in universe), right? It would be cool if it spilled over with some effect increased by AP. Sunfire? Something else?",2021-05-14 01:49:25,0.0,nbmnrl
hgob5,CoolKnightST,"**Intro**

Let's go back in time:

*Healing used to be a mechanism that was a privilege to receive. Healing was gated by cooldowns, mana, low base values, poor scaling, etc.. Naturally not many champions even had a heal in their kit.*

Currently, it's literally the opposite. If you don't have healing (or receive a heal from other sources) you are pretty much trolling. 

**The problem**

I like the change of design, however, they should have done their homework:

In every single successful game where this kind of design is implemented, there is a separation between healing (natural body healing) and blessings (healing, miracles usually from spells or gifts from gods). The previous design didn't need this separation because healing was just too low in numbers or unique to a specific champion to even matter.

**A solution**

The best way to address this kind of problem is just straight up make the separation. The following abilities would be changed to blessing:

* Soraka Q, W & R 
* Kayle W
* Soraka, 
* Yuumi
* etc...

Every class will get an option to counter blessing in the form of corruption:

* Mage: Oblivion orb 2th build into item: that reduces the effects of blessing by 70%
* Support:  Chemtech Putrifier will reduce blessing as well.
* Assassin: They gain a similar item as Serpent's Fang (or they could receive the debuff on blessing as well)
* Marksmen: Second build path option on Executioner's Calling 
* Bruisers:  Chempunk Chainsword will gain a blessing debuff when the enemy is below 50% of their max health.
* Tanks: Gain a 2nd build option on bramble where the item provides an aura that reduces the effect of blessing by x%.

With this form of separation, you are able to tweak the numbers around and healing would have a lot less balance problems in the long run.",2021-05-13 23:36:46,0.0,nbjgwe

3leqzkvd,durex_dispenser_69,"Hello, 

Wanted to follow on the earlier posts about the LDL playoffs with a list of the best prospects based purely on this split. I've managed to catch about 65-70% of all the LDL games this split due to WFH, and the only teams I've really not seen a lot of are the absolute bottom feeders like LGDY or ESY. 

TOPLANE

General thoughts: This year the top of the pool is pretty stacked and we should see 3-4 people going into LPL next year. I won't mention names like IGY Neny who will likely not be available or are way too raw to be in next split. Next year there are pretty big moves expected at top in LPL so a lot of these names will be in play IMO.

FPB Xiaolaohu- Probably the best prospect overall. Was pretty huge for FPB in his first split and was a big carry during the whole split with a good champion pool and good mechanics. He has to get better at weaksiding but its as good a top prospect as you can get. Given that FPX has Nuguri I don't expect him to be stashed, but FPX might decide where he goes like they did with PPGOD.

YM Qingtian- Most unique prospect and the finals MVP of today. Offers the best weaksiding and has a special ability to provoke enemies into making mistakes. Very interesting champion pool. One downside is that he has a lot of coinflip moments and gets carried away with trying to make plays sometimes, so when he falls behind he can really fall behind. He will likely get better by end of the year so expect him to be seen

SDX Zaza- Basically rounds out the top 3. I think he is as good in terms of potential as the other 3 , but he has a weird playstyle where he likes to sit in lane and doesn't really interact with his jungler or team all that much unless he has to. But mechanically he is right up there. SDX was built around Kepler this year but he was the clear 2nd carry on the team and given that SDX is a farm team he will likely be picked up next year. Ideally he needs to be on a team where he doesn't need to carry immediately.

Pinnacle Shanji- Finished 2nd place in MVP voting despite his team being in 16th place. He is a 3 year prospect but at this point he is way too good for LDL and the only reason why he doesn't have ungodly stats is because Pinnacle is absolute trash. His floor is above the other 3 prospects, not sure about the ceiling.

JUNGLE

General thoughts: Jungle this year is not really exciting. With B3st16 being banned there isn't a slam dunk jungler above anyone else, and the LPL jungle pool is so stacked that you really need to smurf to be considered. I'll put down 2-3 names but none really excite me. Won't mention guys like xiaohuangren or tianzhen who are way too raw.

YM Heng- Probably the best option. The only really inspring rookie jungler, he has a good understanding of the map, good champ pool and good mechanics. Not much else to say, the one position you can trust PDD with is Jungle and he could be very good. Only concern is that he jungles for really good lanes and we don't know how he will jungle at a deficit.

SDX Beige- After SJG went down due to matchfixing he rejoined SDX at the end of the split. On SDX he had some problems with synergy with the rest of the team(they only played together for like a month though) but overall had a good split. He does have a few problems with reading the map and being over aggressive, and he already played for 4 splits, but who knows he could work on a bad team.

LNGY pzx- Man I don't feel great putting this guy as he really isn't gonna cut it at the LPL level IMO, but who knows? LNG will likely sell him if there is interest since they have Tarzan so he might make a team.

MIDLANE

General thoughts: Mid isn't great this year, there is Xiaocaobao and then there's everyone else. I will only put 3 prospects here because given how stacked LPL midlane is most of these guys would need a quantum leap to make it in next year.

YM Xiaocaobao- Basically the big prize in this year's LDL lottery. The big attraction here is the Chovy-esque farming instincts (9.92 cs/min at LDL level is unheard of) and complete mastery of all the control mages. Is he already playing at a top 10 level for the LPL? That is the big question. Expect a nuclear arms race for this guy. Might even be picked up before summer begins. My slight concern with him is that he doesn't push his leads as hard as possible, but that could just be him playing really safe.

FPB Care- I will mention Care only because I think that this might be DoinB's successor on FPX. He has a lot of things he needs to sort out before he can go into the LPL, namely work on his farming and control mages play, but his mechanics are really good and he has a good understanding of the game. No way FPX lets him get bought out, he performed super well in his first split and they will likely keep him around as he will likely only get better. He was the clear 2nd best midlaner in LDL for me.

LGDY Haichao- This is my ultra low odds pick for a guy who will eventually make it to the LPL. I've only seen like 5 LGDY games and every single time he looks like a guy who is just elohelled with branless teammates(with the exception of TTH). He would need to jump orgs to really shine, but I like how he plays the lane and tries to save the map before his team inevitably ints him.

ADC

General thoughts: This is the best position in this year's LDL by a large margin. There are plenty of guys who are not prospects (Able,Asura,Xiaguang,Hope) completely styling on most of the pool,but there are 3 absolutely great ADC prospects and plenty of sleepers.A lot of teams are an ADC away from doing damage so I would be surprised if these guys don't go.

SDX Kepler- Kepler is widely considered the best ADC in the class. He was really good last summer, but this split he came back and became even better. Farms extremely well, does a lot of dmg, doesn't die a lot and just has good decision making and mechanics. His 2 supports skiin/shadow are kind of meh so he could look even better with an actual support in LPL. Would love to see V5 get him to pair him with ppgod. Basically as good an LDL ADC as we've seen.

YM Xing- I think Xing is worse than Kepler but not by a lot. He has an extra split of experience on Kepler but man he would be a good ADC on a lot of the bottom teams. Don't really have problems with any parts of his game, maybe deflate his stats a bit due to him playing on a stacked team but still, very good prospect.

Joy Dream LPC- Now this guy is the definition of 1v9 and the only reason Joy Dream was even barely above 50% WR. Finished joint first in the MVP ladder. He was a monster last year already but this year its just even more obvious with a worse roster, the mechanics, the farming, the big plays are all there. Some org will either buy him out or JDG will start him over Loken/Mystic if they underperform again. 

LNGA LP- This guy is in the weirdest position out of all the ones I mentioned. On the one hand, LNG has a really good ADC in Light. On the other hand, LP looks like he has scary potential and could make another team better. I do think his stats are a bit inflated due to him playing with the best LDL support in Kedaya, but he is a top 5 adc for sure. Name to look out for for the future.

TY GuiGui- I expect ThunderTalk gaming to think about promoting him next split because quite frankly SamD has been very uninspiring. Is GuiGui LPl ready? No. Will ThunderTalk think about promoting him regardless? Yes, because they will likely suck again. In a year this guy can be really dangerous, kind of raw in terms of game knowledge, but I have a suspicion TT might ruin his confidence if they start him too early.

SUPPORT

General thoughts: I don't personally like the support pool this year largely, most of them don't look great or are getting carried by their adc. Support position in LPL is decent so these names below could see play.

LNGA Kedaya- For me this is the best support so far, but like LP he is in a weird position. The mechanics are crisp, the roaming is good, can play all the meta supports, knows when to all in, just good. He might be better than Iwandy, which is why I don't expect LNG to let him test the market and keep him in academy. If Iwandy sucks then we could see him on LNG next year. If he doesn't, well then Kedaya might be forced to play LDL.

FPB Shenyi- Shenyi is the same story as Care. Great prospect, already really good, would be picked up by a team if he was available but FPX will likely save him in order to replace Crisp in the future. Can play absolutely everything based on last year and this year. By next year he has a very high chance of being moved to be a sub on the main team.

YM Ke- I'll put Ke here just to recognize that he is a top 5 LDL support, but IMO he has nowhere the upside of the other 2. If you want a good support to come into the LPL and be ready immediately and not hold back your ADC, this is your guy. Main problem is that he has like 3 years of experience of LDL at this point, so he might be a high floor  low ceiling guy. He could already be better than some LPL liabilites like LvMao.

That's basically it. There are other guys that could be LPL ready after next split ends, but from what I've seen and the relative needs of LPL at each of the positions this should be the list. I could try to answer questions about particular prospects from most teams except the ones I haven't seen.",2021-05-13 03:16:43,16.0,nawveo

kombuof,Gentzer,"Hello again, brutes and heathens. I have returned to continue this long running tradition of...uh...2 weeks ago, of giving you the truth behind the Kefka-esque nightmare we call a ""balance patch"".

With MSI in full swing, and the ACTUAL tournament starting in a few days, we finally have a patch untouched by pros to really shake things up. Of course, just because we COULD, doesn't mean we DID. 

Anyway!

**BARD**

Due to the woeful state of support income nowadays, supports like Bard have fallen on hard times. Recently it came to light that Bard has thus not been compensating his Meeps appropriately for their existence as his passive. In retaliation, the Meeps are striking by not really trying anymore when Bard flings them to their death. We wish the noble Meeps luck on their protest.

**DARIUS**

So when we nerfed Garen last patch, it turns out that WASN'T the Stridebreaker using, big beefy boi we were supposed to hit. I was ready to nerf Sett as a result but the boss just told me apparently you've been referring to Darius all this time! Threw me for a loop.

Anyway, we feel the best way to nerf this longstanding menace, is to give you a whole extra 2 SECONDS between Darius beating your ass. You may applaud when ready.

**GALIO**

Galio is going to be taunting a little less this patch. This comes after Galio's recent Promos, where he heinously referred to his opposing laner as a ""big meanie"". A Chat suspension was swiftly dispatched and Galio has learnt his lesson.

**JINX**

BUGFIX: Jinx is no longer a better jungler...than the jungler.

Also how the fuck does she have LESS armor!?! Have you SEEN how little she wears?

**KATARINA**

Katarina has been you guys' favourite punching bag as of late, and honestly, Yuumi is feeling a little abandoned as public enemy no.1 now. While a certain other change should help this, we feel Katarina could also do with some touches. So, for changing the assassin who blinks around approximately 1x10^13 times a laning phase, we're gonna hit her movespeed.

**KAYLE**

Do you guys remember the beginning of preseason, where Kayle was a complete terror? Yeah us neither.

**KENNEN** 

As part of our usual campaign of systematically destroying the minds of every top laner in league, allow us to introduce the Kennen Buffs!

With G2 (and by extension, Rekkles) out of MSI, we can finally buff Kennen's W a bit and hope that Swedish mfer doesn't play him bot again.

**LUX**

Alright everyone, flip a coin, heads says this buff means new Demacia lore, tails says new skin.

**SEJUANI**

Turns out Bristle has a bit of a squint, who knew? Even more surprising is the knowledge that you can apparently buy boar-sized glasses! Bristle can see much better now.

**TALON**

It is with great sadness that we announce that Talon's most favourite blade: Mr. Stabby has gone missing, probably in a Vayne somewhere. While the hunt continues for it's safe return, Talon will have to substitute for his duller backup: Senior Incisor.

**THRESH**

After we finally, fucking finally killed Hecarim last patch, we're taking a stab at killing off another undead menace. Expect to see him another 5 or so patches in a row before we finally figure out what's wrong with the creepy bastard.

**YUUMI**

In our ongoing campaign to destroy the minds of all League players, building off of our successful work of annihilating top laners self-worth, we bring you buffs to this pussy.

Just dodge the skillshot 4Head.

**ZYRA**

So the boss man upstairs told me yesterday; and this is a direct quote, to ""shit on Zyra, that bitch cost me Iron II"". So I did exactly as instructed, but I don't think my boss has heard of fertilizer...

**ABYSSAL MASK**

We've heard your calls for better MR itemisation, and so it is with great joy we introduce the newest item to League of Legends: Abyssal Mask! We went through a couple of iterations to get this just right, including one wacky idea for an item that reduced magic damage from the same effect, but that never would've worked.

**GOREDRINKER**

We were there. We were finally ready to kill Goredrinker, and with it, finish off that dastardly Olaf and Aatrox once and for all! But you just had to push it. You just had to...read. Now we have to actually buff the item instead of ""buffing"" it. What comes next...is on you.

**GUINSOO'S RAGEBLADE**

SUPER SALE! GUINSOO'S 200G OFF! EVERYTHING! MUST! GO! BIG SALE BEFORE WE REWORK GUNISOO'S FOR THE 7TH TIME!

No seriously, Guinsoo's has been reworked more than fucking **Ryze** has. Let that sink in.

**RIFTMAKER**

Our final item change is a Totally-Not-a-Morde-Buff. This should help many of its intended users, including but not limited to, The-Champion-Whose-Getting-A-Skin-Soon.

**PHASE RUSH**

Speed limits have been implemented on Summoner's Rift, as too many of you were going way too fucking fast. Except for Rammus. Rammus is ok.

**JUNGLE CHANGES**

That's right! It's time for our annual nuking of the jungle!

So for our ""friends"" in the irradiated wastes of the jungle, I've got good news and bad news.

Bad news is, we're fucking around with all the camp's numbers again. Because you guys got used to new last batch and that's unacceptable. Who wants to guess what the Mini Krugs are worth now! Also we're making Smite a consistent flat number so fuck your hard-earned level advantage.

Good news is we finally learnt that ""Catch-Up"" doesn't mean ""I skipped one camp to gank the perma-pushing Yasuo (yeh I'm talking about you)"" so we're bringing it back in a scaled down capacity that should actually do what it's supposed to! At least until we rework the jungle again in 10 months.

**MISC**

And to wrap up, we have turned Kog'Maw into the prettiest little butterfly. Unless you're not using Monarch Kog'Maw, in which case, you are objectively doing it wrong.

And that does it! Bot lane, enjoy getting screwed by Zyra, and screwed over by Yuumi abandoning you. Top lane, say hi to Kennen for us, and junglers, fuck you. Mid laners, you just enjoy yourselves, you lovely little money makers you.

See you in 2 weeks!

838x7dkh,Olding0,"Ever since the item rework I always felt Stormrazor a bit underwhelming, it feels like it is trying to do damage and be a bit of utility, and failing at both. It does less damage than all other second itens like Essence reaver, collector, LDR or even some zeal items like PD. Also all this itens scale much better than stormrazor.

 The slow is nice but it lasts so little, even Duskblade that has a 0.25 99% slow feels more impactful. Also let's include the shield from BT it is so much more impactful than the slow if we count it as a utility.

I just feel like this item was made out of zeal, reduce the ad a bit and maybe the cost, It would feel much much better. Move speed is something so important on marksmen.

About Statikk shiv, I really don't understand its removal. I really think it wasn't too strong neither underwhelming on the spot it was removed. It was a niche little item in some spots, especially with stormrazor. I remember using it on waves and getting the slow on carries and the slow was enough to set up a engage like naut and other champs. It also was amazing with stormrazor when the enemy team liked to clump up getting those nice 5 man slows. Tho niche it was nice

I don't think it competed with hurricane for a marksmen item for waveclear. They had different styles. Hurricane was most efficient when you could attack the creeps non stop. Also the bolt, if I'm not mistaken scaled with the ADC Range, so it was better on long range adcs than low range ones. And stattikshiv worked more in bursts, it comboed specially well when the adc had a AOE spell like cait or jhin.

Let's not forget about that fun build that you would go all the energized itens, Rapidfire Stormrazor Statikkshiv and the kircheis shard. It was troll but it was hella fun!",2021-05-13 06:02:18,7.0,nb0p44

Thanks to the [Undisputed Competitive Tier List](https://twitter.com/LSXYZ9/status/1389671647842500610) and representation of the best team from each region ([kind of](https://static.invenglobal.com/upload/image/2021/04/19/r1618847541036042.jpeg)), we can _objectively_ determine which the _**Best Drafting Region in the World**_ is! So, let's dig into some _analysis_.

---

Because no one really likes letters (and/or to make my life easier), I've numbered the tiers:


* Z (Broken) = 5
* S = 4
* A = 3
* B = 2
* C = 1
* DONT = 0


Thanks to this fool proof conversion, we can put a score to each draft of MSI. _With some caveats:_


* If a team picked a champion not on the tier list, it counts as a score of 0 but does not contribute to the tally of DONTs. Maybe it should, but if the Pope made no such declarations, who am I to?
* Lane swap is just prolonged roaming. We don't care if your Oriana hung out in top lane a lot; it was still a mid _pick_.
* Because _[there are no over-powered champions in mid-lane](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Sion_0.jpg)_, the maximum team score from a draft is actually 24 (or 4.8 average per player).

Now, thanks to some _[advanced maths](https://infoinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Find-Average-in-Google-Doc-Sheets.jpg)_, we can convert a team's drafting score back into a tier list grade. For the sake of a bit more granularity, if a score has been rounded up to a new grade, it has been cursed with a 'minus' suffix. For example, a 2.8 becomes an A-.

---

With that out of the way, here are some stats:


Team | Worst Draft | Best Draft | Z Picks | DONT Picks | Average _Team_ Score | Grade
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
C9 | **9** | **18** | 4 | **3** | 13.67| A-
PGG | _3_ | 16 | **5** | 8 | 10.56 | B
MAD | 4 | 14 | 2 | 4 | 9.83 | B-
INF | 6 | 12 | 2 | 4 | 9.67 | B-
DK | 5 | 12 | 3 | 6 | 9.17 | B-
IW | 6 | 12 | 2 | 7 | 9.17 | B-
PNG | 6 | _11_ | _0_ | 5 | 9.00 | B-
PSG | 4 | 13 | 3 | 5 | 9.00 | B-
RNG | 4 | 15 | 4 | 8 | 9.00 | B-
DFM | 5 | _11_ | 1 | 4 | 8.33 | B-
UOL | 4 | _11_ | 3 | _11_ | 8.00 | B-

In other words, we can safely, without a doubt, say that **North America is the best drafting region in the world**! _(And LCL is the worst.)_

With the formalities and [champagne](https://media.tenor.com/images/9f332ca8b4f89f968a0bc8cd02d7c764/tenor.png) out of the way, let's dive a bit deeper.

How did teams _perform_ with these drafts?

* The **win rate** with a _superior draft_ landed at **51.35%**.
 * ^^I'm ^^not ^^going ^^to ^^lie, ^^when ^^I ^^started ^^tracking ^^these ^^numbers ^^properly ^^on ^^day ^^2 ^^and ^^it ^^was ^^at ^^25%, ^^this ^^stat ^^was ^^a ^^lot ^^more ^^fun.
 * In Group A, it was 46.15%.
 * In Group B, it was 50.00%.
 * In Group C, it was 58.33%.

**Did any particular team benefit more from _superior drafts_ than others?** I'm glad you asked!



Team | Overall Win Rate | Win Rate w/ _Superior Draft_
---|---|----
C9 | 66.7% | 60.0%
DFM | 33.3% | 33.3%
DK | 83.3% | 100%
INF | 16.7% | 50%
IW | 16.7% | 0.0%
MAD | 83.3% | 75%
PGG | 33.3% | 42.9%
PNG | 33.3% | 50.%
PSG | 66.7% | 66.7%
RNG | 100.0% | 100.0%
UOL | 22.2% | 25.0%

The obvious conclusions to draw from this is that ~~draft tiers didn't really matter~~ TCL can't win without cheese ^^...and ^^even ^^then ^^they ^^don't, ^^really and LLA are hard carried by overpowered champions.

**But how does it break down by role?!**

* Top Lane
 * The average top lane score was 1.8 (B-)
 * The _highest average_ top lane score by any team was 3.0 (A) by INF
 * The _lowest average_ top lane score by any team was 1.0 (C) by _the boys_ at PGG
* Jungle
 * The average jungle score was 2.7 (A-)
 * The _highest average_ jungle score by any team was 3.5 (S-) by C9 and DK
 * The _lowest average_ jungle score by any team was 1.2 (C) by UOL
* Mid Lane
 * The average mid lane score was 2.0 (B)
 * The _highest average_ mid lane score by any team was 3.0 (A) by PGG and IW
 * The _lowest average_ mid lane score by any team as 1.0 (C) by DFM
* ADC
 * The average ADC score was 1.6 (B-)
 * The _highest average_ ADC score by any team was 3.7 (S-) by C9
 * The _lowest average_ ADC score by any team was 0.8 (B-) by DK, INF, and IW ^until ^they ^picked ^Tristana ^into ^the ^last ^game ^against ^DK, ^INF ^were ^averaging ^a ^DONT ^in ^the ^ADC ^role
* Support
 * The average support score was 1.5 (C)
 * The _highest average_ support score by any team was 2.0 (B-) by PSG
 * The _lowest average_ support score by any team was 1.2 by DFM, DK, MAD, and INF

In other words, the **worst drafted role was support** while the **best drafted role was jungle**.

Now here is a category that would probably have fit in better a bit further up, but I'm not changing the format now; **average draft by GROUP:**


Group | Average Score | Grade
---|---|----
A | 9.2 | 1.84
B | 9.3 | 1.85
C | 10.2 | 2.04

So, going into the [Rumble Stage](https://thumbs.static-thomann.de/thumb/orig/pics/bdb/429359/13013434_800.jpg), DK and C9 should be clear favourites, while RNG and PGG are the underdogs. But hey, let's rewind! From _earlier stats_, we can see that Group A are the ^^draft KING SLAYERS, so perhaps you shouldn't discount RNG so quickly!

---

Those are the group stats. Kind of. I haven't really categorised things, but it's sort of how it turned out, in retrospect. Well, not really. ANYWAY. Now let's look at some _other_ stats.

* The **average draft score** for a _team_ across the entire group stages was **9.5** (B-)
* The **highest scoring _match_** was the very last one of the tournament, INF vs C9, at **28** (A-)
 * Incidentally, the **second highest scoring match** was the _first_ one of the tournament, DK vs C9, at **26** (a lower A-) ^tied ^with ^PGG ^vs ^RNG ^on ^day ^2
* The last match of the tournament was also the **match with the highest floor**, where the lesser drafting team (INF) scored a **12** (B)
* The **best draft in a single match** was C9 at **18** (S-) in the first game of the tournament against DK (it was also a loss)
* The **_worst_ draft in a single match** was PGG at **3** (C-) in a loss against UOL (where UOL scored a 9)
* The **most Z tier champions in a single game** was _again_ the first and last games of the tournament; C9 picking 3 Z-tier champions in game 1 against DK and C9 again with 2 Z-tier champions vs INF's 1 Z-tier champion in the last game of the tournament ^this ^tournament ^really ^was ^book-ended ^by ^some ^_amazing_ ^drafts
* The **most DONT tier champions in a single game** was in UOL's second win against PGG, where UOL had 1 DONT tier champion and PGG had _3_ (this is the game where PGG also scored a total of 3 points in the draft)

---

Finally, before the tournament even started, **[a concern was raised](https://twitter.com/LSXYZ9/status/1389671647842500610)**:

> The pain is in knowing that B/C tier champs will likely make up the majority.

So, did they? Let's count!


For the sake of sneaking in some more fun stats, let's first break it down by role:



Tier | Top | Jungle | Mid | ADC | Support
---|---|----|----|----|----
Z (Broken) | 5 | 16 | - | 10 | 1
S | 8 | 15 | 13 | 4 | 0
A | 1 | 17 | 5 | 14 | 2
B | 20 | 3 | 25 | 1 | 28
C | 34 | 1 | 28 | 11 | 41
DONT | 6 | 22 | 1 | 34 | 2

Additionally, we had two _tierless_ champions: Kog'maw and Yasuo into mid-lane ^Yasuo ^wasn't ^in ^the ^list ^for ^mids, ^right? ^I've ^looked ^through ^it ^like ^a ^dozen ^times ^and ^can't ^see ^him . Let's tally these up:

Tier | Picks
---|---
Z | 32
S | 40
A| 39
B | 77
C | 115
DONT | 65
Untiered | 2



So, the specific phrasing is ""B/C tier champs"", so are there more champions from B and C than all the other tiers (and tierless) combined?

**Champions from Tiers B and C:** 192

**Champions from Tiers Z, S, A, DONT, and Tierless:** 178

So yeah, 51.89% of all picks came from tiers B and C. The concern was valid and ""correct""! And if we go more generous and look at 'B tier _or worse_' the number jumps up to **70%**.

---

1onmkenk,ThexLoneWolf,"An alternate gamemode idea I had inspired by Counterstrike and Valorant. The idea of the gamemode is take the gameplay from Summoner's Rift and place it in a round-based elimination mode. Here's how the mode is played. First, at the start of the game, each team drafts their champions in the same manner as if we were playing on Summoner's Rift. At the start of the first round, each player begins at level 3 and gets a flat 1500 starting gold to buy their first items from the shop. After a 20 second prep phase, the players are locked out of the shop and are released into the mode's map, the Blasted Arena.

[A mockup of the Blasted Arena I made in MSPaint. To give an idea of scale, the spawn rooms on either side of each hall at the top of the map are about as large as the Baron pit.](https://preview.redd.it/0vj7i61dcsy61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=b123798d785cca13a29de154361e53050b7a8eff)

The arrows on the map represent gold and item canisters. Canisters are specific to this map, and reward the first five champions to claim them with gold and items. The color of the arrow represents the tier of gold canister. The green canister gives 100 gold, the blue canisters 300, the purple 1200, and the yellow canister gives 3000 gold. The red canister gives you a choice of 3 legendary or mythic items that are appropriate to your champion to claim for free (think like the recommended tab in the shop on Summoner's Rift). However, only one champion may claim the red canister per round. Items, gold, and levels are carried over from round to round, even if you died in the previous round.

To win a round, one team must eliminate the other, hence the small size of this map: the Blasted Arena is very teamfight oriented. Rounds are equally short: just 2 minutes. When one team is completely eliminated (no respawns per round), both teams reappear in their spawn rooms and the prep phase begins again, except this time, each player is awarded a flat 1000 gold and gets 3 additional levels (completing rounds, win or loss, is the only way to level up on the Blasted Arena). If at least one member of either team is left standing when the round ends, the winner of the round is determined by which team has the greater number of players, but if that doesn't settle the tie, both teams score 1 point. To win a game of Blasted Arena, a team must win at least three rounds with a two round margin. If both teams battle to a 4-4 tie, the game mode enters ""Sudden Death."" In round nine, the health of all champions is set to 500, regardless of any bonus health or levels, and the time limit is disabled completely. 

The idea of the Blasted Arena was to stay as true to the gameplay of Summoner's Rift as possible while  adapting it to an elimination style mode. Would appreciate any thoughts on a game mode like this.",2021-05-13 09:14:20,5.0,nb4s6b

With this information and what we have seen so far GAM would have definitely qualified from group A, and would likely outperform PSG to place 5th. ***While a clickbait comment like ""GAM have a perfect matchup against C9"" or ""GAM could place top 4 at MSI"" are not unrealistic, 5th would be the expected result for GAM.***  


**For worlds GAM's dominance will likely carry their momentum into summer and take a worlds spot however the second seed has a battle of concepts for their potential 2nd.**  


Assuming that VCS does receive a second seed for Worlds the battle for 2nd in the VCS will likely come down to two teams. Saigon Buffalo (formerly Phong vu Buffalo) at first glance this split looked like an academy team, with 4! rookies in their 6 man roster, SGB's rookies received all 3 places in the  [VCS English ](https://twitter.com/vcs_english/status/1384139079768436741) rookie of the split Award

[BeanJ \(Jungle\) Taki \(Support\) Arrietty \(Bot\) take all 3 spots in the rookie of the split award](https://preview.redd.it/wewc3k0utpy61.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa06bea4d3fec3ee0e6bf53c1e69e14f99ee557e)

BeanJ has provided the only significant competition this split, and Taki has rapidly overtaken Palette as the 2nd best support in the league, while Arrietty only received 24 points that isn't because Arrietty isn't good but simply because BeanJ and Taki were so dominant. Siagon Buffalo's   
   
***Not only do have SGB committed to having 4 great rookies in their main team, with their oldest player being just  19, they already have 3 of of the top 10 players in VN soloqueue in thier academy team.***  


Their competition comes in the form of the classic minor region strategy, *importing Koreans*, with Cerberus Esports import Poss (formerly of WE) to join their Korean owner & coach Icarus. ***Cerberus will likely play the first ever import in the VCS this split.*** Cerberus were not a weak team before their import joined either, winning 3-2 against SGB throughout the split, before losing 3-1 in playoffs.

5z55evnz,HalexUwU,"A total presence in the MSI tournament of 5%, its possible we see this go up later in the tournament, but I'd guess its relatively unlikely.  


I think it's time we actually talk about why enchanters, including Lulu, are so bad unless they're either bugged (Seraphine with moonstone), or extreme flex picks (Karma, who's currently picked into four different roles).

&#x200B;

# It's actually really easy to explain: Bot Tower

&#x200B;

Right now ganking bot makes too much sense, there's simply too many reasons to do it.

&#x200B;

* Two people botside

By default there's always 2 players bot side, three with a gank, four/five people bot before 15 minutes isn't uncommon either. Because of the natural player advantage of bot side tower diving is much easier since there are simply more players to switch between, on top of this tower diving is much easier with a tank/engage support.

&#x200B;

* Tower Platings

In top and mid for the first few minutes of the game both towers gain protection, taking less damage from minions and players, because of this getting a successful gank usually does not result in as many tower platings. A gank bot side can often result in 2-4 platings (since an ADC, and a support are both doing damage, possibly other allies. No tower protection meaning its easier to do damage). It also doesn't help that most enchanters don't break towers as fast as melee supports who can take demolish, really the only enchanters that help get towers faster are Janna and Lulu since they both have some kind of AD/AS steroid.

&#x200B;

* Level Differences

A lot of enchanters actually are quite good at preventing tower dives, it just happens that they're reliant on level 6 to do so. A Janna, Seraphine, or Sona are all *really* hard to towerdive once they have their ultimates, but until then they are all very venerable. Since botlane gets levels slower it makes dives much easier. Tank supports can take more damage while being dived, enchanters just can't.

&#x200B;

* Early Dragons

This one's quiet simple, fighting for early dragons is much easier if you have an early game support. That's basically it.

&#x200B;

* Shorter Laning phases

Because of Towers falling faster with tank supports (due to all the reasons above) laning phases are shorter meaning enchanters have less time to get items before they have to teamfight. Some enchanters really don't mind this, Seraphine and Sona both love this, but for other's it's basically a death sentence. Trying to go into team fights as Taric with only your mythic is suicide (Yes I know taric is *technically* a tank support but you usually go 1-2 enchanter items). 

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

Almost everything somehow ties into bot tower, and generally until bot tower is changed somehow the pro support meta isn't going to change; The pro support meta is stuck with tanks. Enchanters won't be good in pro play, even if they are objectively overpowered, until something about bot lane changes. The botside meta is just too punishing for enchanters to be good which has resulted in them being played in other lanes entirely (Top lane, Mid, even ADC). Enchanters are clearly strong in pro play, we've seen them played in all kinds of weird places, but support just isn't one of them.",2021-05-13 00:45:22,14.0,nat9xk

And maybe a stacking mechanism for his Q. On champion kill or Epic monster kill (Baron,Dragon,Blue sentinel and red brambleback).  Mordekaiser's Q cooldown is perminately decreased by 0.01 seconds.

If we do the math and give a generous amount of 15 kills,8 assists 1 baron and 3 dragons and 3 blue buffs and 3 red buffs. A typical laning mordekaiser will have a decrease in Q cooldown by (0.01\*15)+(0.01\*8)+(0.01\*1)+(0.01\*3)+(0.01\*6)= 0.015+0.08+0.01+0.03+0.06= 0.33 second decrease on his Q cooldown.

Now calling back to Annie's changes, they made her E into an actual shield she can cast on allies.Is she a good support? That's variable, but it allowed some players to get out of midlane with her.I'm just waiting on someone to mention how certain supports are practically nerfing themselves playing alone- like Sona's mana costs, Leona's useless passive and Rell's useless ability.  


Edit: What I mean by this is that Annie, who has been sort of hard locked to mid for ages got something to work with so that she can not just be locked to mid- and I hope there's something like damage bonuses or the such for supports to leave botlane.

Sure, there are some GREAT supports who can handle themselves in a lane alone- like Lulu.Hell, even Yuumi can play alone and plays GREAT alone.

8xgfwhld,PerkzClappedMyDad,"Hi Reddit,

I think the following 3 ping/communication changes would go a long way to reduce toxicity by improving the Jungler and their respective laners' ability to understand each others intent:

1. Allow Jungler to draw out a line on the minimap visible to teammates to indicate pathing
2. Create ""Pushing"", ""Freezing"", ""I will engage"", and ""You engage first"" pings.
3. Create an ""Accept/Reject"" ping so jungler/laner can quickly provide input without opening chat box.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Let me first say that I'm a hardstuck D3 Mundo Jungle 1 trick. I hit Diamond for the first time in 8 years last year pretty much by abusing the powerfarm jungle meta and Mundo's leashless clear strat. With 11.10, there are some massive jungle changes that, though they will probably negatively impact my powerfarm style of play, I'm absolutely fine with cause admittedly this meta has gotten pretty stale.

That being said, I do not think that any of the in-game changes are going to address the following issues:

1. Toxicity towards Jungler from Laners who do not understand Jungle intent
2. Reduced playerbase for the Jungle Role
3. Mutual understanding between Laners + Jungler on how to play the game

The reason I play League of Legends instead of Chess and Starcraft is BECAUSE it is a team game. It's FUN to win as a team and it's rewarding to feel as though I contributed to our victory. So it's especially disheartening to me that over the years the most effective means of climbing Solo Que in lower elos is to ""Mute All"" and at the highest elos, abuse dodging. This should NOT be the case. It should not be more effective to limit communication rather than engage in it.

Additionally, I think everyone understands at this point that Junglers tend to be flamed a lot more than other roles, which makes the role less desirable to pick up. And finally, the role is constantly changing each year, so its especially difficult for someone who doesn't keep up with each patch to understand what is and isn't optimal and Laners and Junglers will often butt heads because they have differing ideas on how they want to play.

I personally believe that if you bridge the communication gap and make it possible to communicate some basic information between your lanes/jungle, you could make the role a LOT more enjoyable to play.

2 major problems:

1. Limited ability to communicate intent without voice coms and cave-man ping system
2. Misunderstanding on how other team-mates want to play the game and what they expect from you as a Jungler.

I would say about 75% of the time a laner is raging at me is because he doesn't understand what I want to do and I don't understand what he wants from me. Even when I go to gank a lane there's really no way of effectively communicating HOW I want the gank to go down. Does my laner engage 1st, do I initiate? When do I want my laner to move forward, etc...

As it stands right now, I just have to spam ping my laner when I'm ganking and hope he understands based on the urgency and frequency of my pings how quickly I want him to engage. This is dumb. Give me a ""I go in"" or ""You go in"" ping at the very least!

When my laner is beginning to freeze a lane cause he sees his jungler is pathing towards him, he should be able to communicate to me that he wants a gank as I path up! This way I'll be much more cognizant of my HP, Pathing, and smite utilization...

And finally, my laner and I should at the very least be able to ping whether or not we agree or disagree on an idea so atleast we both know whether or not the other party is going to support you or not... Care and on my way pings are great, but a more robust and customizable pin-wheel would go a LONG way.",2021-05-13 04:04:18,4.0,naxzo0

c3e1v64f,OrianaForever,"The past 2 seasons have been very sad as an Orianna main.  I really wish something could be done to shift away from the mobile assassin meta that seems to infect solo Q every season.  Orianna was already hardly picked and also doing poorly and then she got nerfed on top of it.  I now have people calling me a troll for picking her.  I've mained her for years and it's never been this bad.

I don't understand why they made items like Serpents fang and prowlers claw.  It just ruins everything Orianna wants to do.  Yes Zed should be strong early but he should fall off hard late, when my team has Orianna and Lulu our shields need to mean something, when we've managed to scale up Zed Talon Reksai Kayn and all these other assassin picks need to fall off and give control mages and enchanters a chance to shine.

So many champs have shields serpents fang is way too good of an item right now.  When an ADC build LDR they give up damage 30AD for LDR instead of 70 for IE.  Why does serpents fang need 55 ad the item would still be good if you reduced the AD to 25 so that they're actually paying a decent price for the passive.  Same thing with prowlers although in this case I'd really like to see it removed I don't mind a high lethality item but a champion like Zed or Talon shouldn't get a free gap closer on an item.  At the same time we also nerfed seekers to make laning even tougher as a mage of any kind.

Mid lane control mages are being run over by assassins this season and it's very frustrating as someone who doesn't enjoy playing assassins.  Sadly assassins seem to get pushed more and more Akali Fizz Ekko seriously every meta mid laner other than Galio is an assassin.  Orianna and Azir both got nerfed despite tiny pick rates and terrible win rates, this means that people who main these champs still can't win despite having very high mastery on their champs.

The amount of burst damage is just way too high this season to the point I'd prefer to return to the old items.  The push and roam meta needs to change and give other play styles a chance.",2021-05-13 02:29:37,5.0,navrxg

I am new to this game, I have only been playing for a few weeks, and I have found my home in the mid lane, specifically with Neeko. However, I play support as a secondary role. So you can imagine me scrolling the champion list and finding a cute little lighting shuriken-weilding boi. Naturally, I wanted to play him cuz his passive looks suuuuuuuuper fun. I was thinking about this, and I realized that, on paper, he has a lot of potential as a dive support(is that what they're called?), like a less tanky Leona. I.e. dive in with rocket belt, e q w and stun the champ, letting the ADC clean up the kill, and at 6, the q isn't even necessary and can be replaced with an eqr. Additionally, poking with q to stack passive could be great for creating a kill opportunity.

I've started playing League of Legends 5 months ago. In the beginning, it was fun, I used to play with all my friends, we were trash (I still am) but we had fun. Now, I am playing this game when I'm not even having fun, just to pass time. I got way too deep into the game, I even started watching streamers and E-Sports tournaments. 

About 20 minutes ago, I lost yet another 1v1 to another summoner and I feel like my day is ruined. I want to stop playing this game. Players that have left this game, please explain to me how you have managed to do it, this game is slowly ruining my life, genuinely.",2021-05-13 19:36:04,0.0,nbejyi
cbxf9,1chazz1,"First of all, sorry for my english, I just want to share my experience with the report system that league has.

So first of all, I want to leave one thing clear. I never report a player if he is having a bad game, no matter if he picked yasuo jungle and he is 0/20. As long as he tries to play the game, even with some tears in the middle, i dont find that reportable.

In my past months I had some really racist and homophobic comments. So times I talk back something like ""Man it's just an ARAM try to have fun"", sometimes i ignore them completly, but some comments are really hard to take on.

It's sad if they wish to someone to get cancer if you personally know someone going throw that. It's really sad if they mock some jobs like clear the streets if you know something that does it. Homophobic coments are also really, really sad.

Some games I find myself with an Orihana support, inting, flaming me and saying that the game was lost because i didnt contest the read vs 4 with her. Even though I dont care that we lost the game, sometimes i think that they cry, they report me back, and in the end I'm the one punished.

&#x200B;

Does riot even has somekind of algorithm to look at this?

&#x200B;

 I imagine that its impossivel for a team of (let's say) 100 persons to look at the billions of daily reports (and most of them are just because some player had a bad game).

Shouldn't the tribunal system be back? (Like in DOTA)

I just want to have a nice a simple ARAM, or Draft pick after work. It was because of this behaviour that I left rank a long time ago.

I know, i could just mute all, but sometimes it feels really good to talk with the stranger about his play, or to do something funny, or just to talk, we are on time that its really hard to have some good conversation with someone.

I'm just here to say to you guys:It's alright if you have a bad game. I'm sorry if I lost my lane, or I'm just deleted on ARAM. Please just enjoy the game, or at least talk about my bad play in a funny way. My family has nothing to do with this game.",2021-05-13 02:59:21,4.0,nawgon

I noticed that in Demacia, the rural culture revolves around hunting which is very reminiscent to the real world in western country's particularly in majority white rural towns etc. So when you compare to real world culture, you see that a lot of the rural life depicted in Demacia is similar to medieval European rural life. So what I wanted to ask is, is this type of rural life also present in different country's in Runeterra as well? Or is this concept alien to the other regions? For example, in Ionia, Shurima, Ixtaal, etc, we don't see this type of lifestyle depicted there, so perhaps Demacia was suppose to be a typical medieval European look-alike country and a lot of it's culture seems very different from other lands across Runeterra.",2021-05-13 08:20:26,2.0,nb3om5

finally, after 10 Years of grinding this beautiful game, I finally reached Challenger in SoloQ. My first Season as a fill player back then ended in a clutch final gold-tier-advance. After being hardstuck diamond for years, I made the push to Master in Season 8. I kinda lost my motivation in Season 10, so i dropped to Diamond 1 and didnt play towards the end of the Season. Here I am, back stronger than ever and actually made it to Challenger yesterday. My next goal is to hold this level of play and maybe extend my champion pool a bit to play some competetive league in the near future.

7vtq3zwy,Afro-Borne246,"I have tested this strategy. Just trust and be amazed.

Tip #1: Never mute your team because you can't un-tilt if can't talk to them.

Tip #2: If you notice a teammate tilting never mute because, and I know that this is quite the shocker, they tilt even harder when they know that they're muted. It also makes you look weak and insecure.

Tip #3: If you feed and they start pinging you, never mute since it makes you look weak and insecure. Ask them ""Can you carry the game if I leave right now?"" This will usually scare them and get them to stfu. Yone players are the exception, they all believe they can 1v5.

Tip #4: Never type 'calm down' or 'chill'. Now what I'm about to tell you will 100% blow your mind. It does absolutely nothing, will tilt them to the fucking moon, and will most definitely lose you the game.

Tip #5: Never type 'we scale' if you don't have a Kassawin, a Kayle, or a Yone. Many don't understand scaling in our Elo and saying this can probably lose you the game.

Tip #6: Always ask ,never demand. Even if your call is right, demanding is aggressive and will tilt them to the fucking moon.

e.g. 'Can you push top? you have tp for drake.' vs 'Push top. You have Tp for drake.' Just two words changes how its perceived.

Tip #7: Learn to trash talk. The amount of times you can turn rage-typing into acceptable banter will amaze you.

Tip #8: If 3-4 players have lost the will to play, (Keyword: Lost the will to play), it is usually better to just ff. They'll be uncooperative and will soft-int because they don't give a damn about winning. Keeping them will only worsen everyone's mood for the next game.

Tip #9: This is the fourth time I'm mentioning this because it's just that important. Never mute because it makes you look weak. Don't run from the problem, learn how to manage it.

So many games are won and lost by which team it is that has the asylum patient. Idk how people can spend so much time playing league and not realize that just because you are losing the early game doesn't mean they are going to win the rest of the game. Maybe they watch too many league streams where those games are over in challenger, but its obviously not over when your in plat or gold. I would say about 25% or so are because both teams gave it their all and the enemy was just playing better.

bgcgija,chicky-nuggy,"As a Darius lover and someone with a ton of hours and games with almost 300k mastery points on Darius I know the champion fairly well. I picked him up in season 7 then again in season 9. I like the mix between damage and tankiness that he has. But his main issue was being kited out. Champions like Quinn and Jayce could run around and poke him out while he had very little mobility to move and in many cases would end up dead.



But here's where the issue comes in


We all know that stridebreaker is very...very good on him. He can combine it with a Q for suprise damage, use it for the slow or even pair it with an E for a lot of range. But stridebreaker isnt the main issue.

I think that Ghost is

On patch 10.12 we saw Ghost lose the ramping MS and instead received a flat 20-40% that was then buffed to 24-48% on patch 10.14. These buffs tied with nimbus cloak and celerity remove every issue Darius had with gap closing that inst just hard CC

Stacking MS on Darius isnt new but these buffs brought it to new levels. What I'm trying to get at here is that we need to stop focusing our balance on champion nerfs and more on other things. Ghost needs a nerf, would it nerf Hecarim even further yes. But is that champion already dead? Yes

Why dont they push her more towards support ?
Why cant other champions proc her passive marks with aa ?
This would be such a huge improvement for Lux support. If its too op, nerf Q or E damage a bit. I would prefer a Q basedamage nerf. Since they afjusted the Cooldown there is no reason to mac it first on Support OR Midlane. The CC is still there.

Also with E being untouched you wouldnt make her unplayable midlane with her waveclear.

Also I dont think a Lux would really want to go into aa range, if someone else proc the marks, since every spell has far more range.

In fact, my Grasp of Undying and Taste of Blood alone both already add up to beyond the 'Damage Healed' shown in my post game stats.

Grasp claims it healed me for 792. Taste of Blood claimed it had healed me for 1471. This alone adds up to 2,263.

But there's more, I had 4 stacks of Ravenous Hunter (Which post game, claim its done 0 healing???) AND Riftmaker with 3 Legendary items to go with it (Nashor's Tooth, Void Staff, and Hourglass).

Yes, I know, AOE from shrooms gets reduced healing and that Teemo's E doesn't benefit from omnivamp. But his Q sure as hell does and the healing from Shrooms, despite being reduced, should be doing healing as well. Especially when they pop on 4 or 5 people at once.

Is Omnivamp working? Or not? Am I wasting runes and gold by picking up Ravenous Hunter and Riftmaker? These stats are making me believe that I am. Are they wrong?

and when u do get mid there are normally 3 people begging to play the role, they either troll ur mid game or just cry all game... i enjoy playing mages. but mages are the least dynamic role in terms of positions in other lanes (outside of brand and swain support). its so unbelievably stressful when u don't get ur role and instead ur mid laner just ints their ass off..

and honestly its lame.....

its not a matter of being able to play mid, its the matter of even being given the opportunity to play it and when u are its normally ruined. it gets to the point where i just give up even trying. because if ur playing 3  mid games for every 13 games whats the point...

and honestly i do understand why people troll, because they have just had enough of not getting the role they wanna play, this is even more the case when people have limited time to play (not that its cool to troll).

Some quick notes:

&#x200B;

1. Obviously, this is not meant to be some kind of inflammatory post about LS or Nemesis and their analysis of the current meta. I think both of them are aware that their vision of the most effective tactic available might not always be the one we will see on stage.  I personally think they did an good job overall, especially in the jungle list. I'm a big data geek and this tierlist offers me an opportunity to look at some data from a different angle. I hope you'll treat this the same way.
2. Both Kog'Maw (MAD vs Pain) and Yasuo (DFM vs DK) were not listed in the midlane tierlist. Regarding Kog'Maw, LS stated that he ""can't go AP"" in the VOD. I considered putting them in the DONT-Tier, but ultimately left them out. Adding them in would raise the DONT-Tier overall WR by 2%.
3. Many games in this first round were far from competitive. It is likely that RNG could have drafted anything and still would have won all the games in their group.
4. Almost all support picks came from the B- or C-Tier (92%). LS and Nemesis are rating enchanter supports higher than engage supports atm, but the former were rarely ever picked (as in once). This skews the overall winrate of the B- and C-Tier a bit and heavily inflates their pickrates.",2021-05-12 06:35:20,45.0,na9qp7

dwetq,BestLeeNigeria,"What are some of the abilites/mechanics you cant believe were in the game for a decent time?

Ill start

- **Rengar Ult**

Rengar Ult atually used to not show a warning whenever he was close to you, in older Seasons a Fed Rengar was probably one of the most obnoxious things to encounter. There was literally no counterplay to getting oneshotted.

Oh and remember in S3 when his Q used to proc on towers with bonus dmg ? Triforce/IE Rengar literally 3 shotting towers in OGN

- **Silcene in general**

Silence was a super broken mechanic on assasins which Riot realized a bit late.

Champs like LB/Kassadin/Talon could 100 to 0 you without you even being able to cast a spell

- **Veigar E**

Believe it or not but the ability that people still consider to be the best non ultimate ability in the game, was actually even stronger.

Veigar E used to be instant, it was incredibly broken and rightfully got changed

- **Akali W after Rework**

Heres a more recent one

After the Akali Rework her W was actually making her invisible under TOWERS. This was way after the invisibility update, so even Pink Wards didnt help. Akali could literally trade & harass you under your own turret without getting punished. Probably one of the worst reworks of an ability ever.


There is more broken stuff but most of these things got hotfixed pretty fast (like the nuke Galio Q etc). Also didnt mention super old things from Season 1 like Jax Dodge",2021-05-11 13:15:14,984.0,n9pilv

91032fcd,n1vlekw,"To be clear, I don't think there's anything wrong with TF's current kit and I think he's in a good spot right now. The thing that bugs me is that he's a card themed character with a kit that has none of the thrill you feel when playing card games or gambling. Now, you might think that things like chance and uncertainty might take away from the skill aspect of League, but isn't crit chance the same concept? I personally think playing TF should make you feel the need to weigh your odds and feel the excitement of risk.

The only abilities that are really related to cards or gambling is his passive and W, everything else is just the standard ability with card effects.

Passive:

\- loaded die, same passive

\- gambling addiction: TF bets a percent of gold he earns from his passive every time he uses his abilities. If the skill succeeds, TF doubles the gold he bets and bets a slightly higher percent the next time. Once the skill fails, TF looses the amount he bets and the betting % returns to original.

\-52 card pickup: TF has a deck of playing cards(the ones we know and love but J, K, and Q would be replaced by red card, blue card, and yellow card), cards are set in a specific order every game so it's possible for players to memorize the order and play according(they do this in the higher levels of many card games) abilities and auto attacks will deal additional damage depending on the number of the card(would lower his current auto damage by 6 so it evens out), if a royal card is thrown(R,B,Y) they would apply very minor effects of tf's old W

Q: I'm combining TF's old Q and W in this one,

\- Q will alternate between three single projectiles as skill shots (cooldown activates after cycle is complete)

\- red blue and yellow cards will still have same effects

\- red card can pass through minions, if collides with enemy deals the aoe damage

\- blue can collide with minions

\- stun is thrown to the ground and stuns whoever steps on card

W: Pick a card, any card: tf lays out the next 7 cards in his deck, after a short amount of time a random card will glow. When that card is used in an ability or as an auto attack, will apply bonus damage. At level 3, two cards will glow. At level 5, 3 cards will glow. Bonus damage will increase with each level

E: Black Jack: TF can press ability again to deal himself a card, or can auto an enemy to deal them a card

\- depending on who the cards are dealt to, deals heals or bonus damage by the number on the card

\- once first card is dealt, a timer starts

\- I win, or you lose: If TF's 3 cards are closer to 21, gains heal and movement speed depending on how close the cards were to 21, if enemy's cards are closer to 21, enemy looses bonus health at the end of timer depending on how close the cards were to 21

\- player can choose to deal three cards to enemy, or three cards to himself in a row for guaranteed heal or damage

\- if cards exceed 21 to TF, deals damage and slow. if cards exceed 21 to enemy, no damage

R: now, this one im not sure about changing. I know how important his ult is, but at the same time it really has nothing to do with cards...

BUT, if I were to change it: cards of fate/tarot collection(global and still gives vision like old ult): TF will predict a misfortune upon a selected enemy that will take effect after a certain amount of time has passed. Will not consume cards in his normal stack of 52

\- Q,W, and E will turn into a tarot card upon activation of ult

Q: straight damage

W: Exhaust sort of thing

E: strong slow

I’m a lvl 180 player and i got a friend who started playing recently.

she’s lvl 19, and we keep having games vs 100k points lvl 400 botlanes (in normz btw).

so here is my question league of legends, how do you want new players to play with their friends without getting their ass pounded non stop ?


this brings up another problem when i thought about making a smurf account.
it was useless bc every other account in games with us where other smurf.

8atxh558,SemanDemon22,Just wondering if anyone has any good stories about randomly meeting a fellow league player out in the real world.  I feel like it would be pretty rare given that the very act of playing league keeps you inside. And in my head the person most likely to tell others about league is a Yasuo main... and we all they have no social skills. In the states everyone talks about and mostly plays FPS and console. So I’ve only met one person (at work) who plays league.  It was amazing to have someone to talk about league with and marvel over the fact that the dessert tray setup at our job looks too much like a thresh lantern when you carry it around.

fwt8k,rascal3199," 

they nerfed the omnivamp by 2% but then decided to buff smite heal which feels like an overall nerf, but then they decided to reduce monster damage?????

they nerfed jungle timers, cool.... but then increased gold so now junglers have even more time to gank and don't lose out on too much gold form it?????

ok so at least thanks to this nerf to timers the jungler will be behind in xp right? cool..... but they added a xp buff when behind 2 levels of the average team level and since it rounds up the jg only needs to be behind 1.1 levels of the average to get xp buff and not stay behind??????

the problem with supports and jg is that they literally can exert insane amounts of map pressure and not have issues with falling behind. Jg had to farm to at least stay ahead in xp and gold but now they can do even less of that and get rewarded for it?

3w9b8lsk,Icer212,"Zilean's passive just feels unecessarily clunky.

Being able to give XP only when it would lead to a level up makes his passive too restrictive. Unless you are roaming, your interactions with the rest of your team are pretty limited in the early game. 

Hoping to also have enough XP stored and being in the presence of someone close enough to level up rarely happens.

Unless the restrictions on his passive get changed, the description might as well be ""help level up your ADC and maybe your jungler.""

umbtksb,TorpazZz,"Hello,

I wanna share with you a power ranking achieved using Machine Learning techniques, comparing all major teams worldwide. Teams entering in this ranking are all teams from LPL/LCK/LCS/LEC and only 1st seed of each wildcard :

https://preview.redd.it/7evelbo9cny61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=f76f5d7b2453db2a806e0c06900476c40fc6dbfd

How was this power ranking calculated :

* This elo ranking uses classical hypothesis. The probability for one team to win vs an other depends purely on both elos A and B, following this formula :

https://preview.redd.it/b8hjoimgcny61.png?width=166&format=png&auto=webp&s=0270d69491b7953ffb2115bb3fd37bc14c9491c5

* As a reference, Damwon Kia is rated at 3000.
* In order to determine win probability, I used odds proposed by bookmakers. Bookmakers propose some of bests estimations of win probabilities using some high-end machine learning algorithms. It is very hard to beat top bookmakers when assessing winrate probabilities. If some of you are interested, I invite you to look at [this website](https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/sports-betting_winners_and_losers.php). It contains plenty of resources on the subject.
* More specifically, I used the odds proposed on the latest matches of each team. For each region, latest playoffs and regular season matches gave win probabilities inside a region, and MSI made the link between regions through inter-region matches odds. This is also why teams from EU Masters for example, don't take part of this ranking : there is no reference as to how they would compete with the rest of the ranking.

It should be well understood that this ranking is far from perfect, because it uses pre-match odds from sometimes a long time ago, since some teams stopped playing a long time ago, and team's momentum takes big place into a team's performance. The elo formula is also very simplistic as it doesn't take into account counter styles between teams. However it's still a good approximation of how teams relate worldwide.

Answering few questions you might think of looking at the results :

* Why is RNG 4th team of China ? RNG was far for the favorite going into LPL playoffs, those 3 teams above had higher winning odds going into the tournament. Although I'm not sure RNG would be favoured as of now in an LPL playoffs, this is a bias of this power ranking methodology : it uses pre-match odds. New odds would probably modify slightly this ranking.
* Why is DK 5th world ? Because RNG is rated higher than DK right now, with a 54% win probability.
* Why is China so high ? Because LPL was very very stacked during regular season and playoffs, while DK was a step above every other Korean team in LCK.
* Why are G2 and Rogue higher than MAD ? Same as above in LPL, G2 and RGE were both favoured going into LEC playoffs.
* Why is NA so low ? Because C9 were undoubtedly favorites during the whole regular season, and yet they were given lower win probability against DK than every other Korean team during the regular LCK season.",2021-05-12 16:03:13,4.0,najg03

1c6z8shu,npsick,"Kayle's buffs in 11.10 absolutely make no sense. She already has a strong early game and an oppressive kit if you're a juggernaut or someone with low mobility. Why is her early game strong? Because she goes press the attack so if you do go in for a trade with her, she autos you and you go even or lose more HP than you should. On top of that, her E costs NO MANA, so she can spam it on you. And, if you're worried about her losing trades, she can go time warp tonic + her W gives her sustain. The buff she received in 11.10 was way too much which makes her a kiting and oppressive monster by level 6 with PTA. 5% AP damage increase for a hyper carry and bonus attack range is just bullshit. You can't even get on top of her most of the time because she can Q you or W away or both and kite you to death.

""Kayle is a little weak across all levels of play, so we’re strengthening her moment of transformative ascension at level 16 so she can rain down damage from above.""

1q2om1it,PurplePuncake,Am i the only person who  imagines a league themed game like hyrule warriors or fate extella link to be super interesting. Just imagine running around the map slashing through tons of enemies with ur fav league champ and then at some point u charge their ult and u get something like the cutscenes in fate extella link but with  the polish and quality of the legends  of runeterra level up scenes and everything just blows up. God the imagination how they could maybe look. If u have no clue check out this https://youtu.be/DDFad-TZRCA imagine something like that in way more polished and modern with an aurelion ult or a nocturne ult or literally any champ in the game. I feel like  the league universe is a  perfect basis for a game like that. Tons of characters a lot of different areas and lore . Idk i d rise from the dead to play that game.,2021-05-12 16:42:13,2.0,najylj

I do understand they might not come in the beginning of the tournament but I had some hope that after witnessing a few ""outplay"" moments, something would drop.

49q535oi,AtreusIsBack,"This should go for all champions across the board. Being able to make yourself immune like that on a cooldown that is lower than 60 seconds is anything but balanced.

All it causes is frustration, then Riot has to find some way to nerf the champion, but they can't because that ability is the core of the champion, so they can't change it in any way.

So the only thing they can do is butcher the numbers to laughable low levels. Buuuut... They won't do that because they don't want to piss off thousands and thousands of players that main those champions. So they're stuck with accepting that a champion is borderline aids to play against, simply because their champion design methodology is bad.

Giving a champion such an effect on a basic ability makes no sense from a game health stand point and I have no idea how that's still a thing 11 years later.

Im sure there will be people here that bought Project Pyke and are not satisfied at all. As a pyke main and like literally all of them are not satisfied at all. It is just revamped version of the base skin and does not add depth to the gameplay at all like other skins do. Im not talking about the emotes. But the skin is basically feels like an epic.

9q3pl7cx,DaimaoCS,"So, first of all, im german so my english is not THAT good but i'll try my best to type it right.

Im a toxic piece of garbage and im typing extremely much and i got chat restricted/honor reset 3 times.

Im not saying that im not responsable for my toxicity but the thing is in real life im a person that gets provoked very easily and i also had a big problem with agressions for a long time.

I went to a Psychiatrist and everything went fine, after 3 years with the Psychiatrist i was a completely new person.

But league, i just cant hold back.

It doesnt matter if the enemy trashtalks me, emotes me, Camps me and ganks me 69 times in 4.20 minutes (Im getting camped the most when i play top) i just cant hold myself back.

Im not proud of my behaviour at all and im pretty sure it annoys my friends too when we want to play clash or when im pissed becazse of some games before.

After getting bullied by 4 cringe kiddos and chat restricted the third time i want to change things.

So i searched and searched what i could do.

And i did everything possible, /muteall, Turning of 
/all chat, mental training (kinda), filters and stuff i just couldnt hold myself back from flaming, raging and afking.

The problem is just that there are too many ways the game triggers u.

U can get camped or something, u cant just mute ganks.

if u turned the whole chat off because u dont want to flame u just afk.

So no matter what i do theres still a way to rage and to express that frustration.

I dont want people to think im the toxic Gangplank Main that flames everybody in all chat because hes getting camped.

I dont want to be a part of this community i want to be a GOOD part of the community, i want to be someone that gets honored by other people and that makes the game more fun for everyone.

I just dont know what to do, im ready to do everything just to be less toxic, i mean i cant just tell u guys to change my personality, but i dont know how to keep my chill.

(Im mainly asking for mental help not for help like ""mute chat"" or ""turn off emotes"".

I want help for my mindset and how to keep my cool at the most extreme moments of a game)

So yeah, i would be happy about every kind of help u guys could give me.

1f0i7lj6,Nickanger,"Hello, my name is Nick Castillo. 

I live in Los Angels California, am 27 years old, and will one day work for Riot Games.

I am an aspiring concept artist and illustrator. I have lurked on this Reddit for many years and have posted fan art for the game in previous years. (links below for reference.) this post for many of you may sound like I'm hoping for a miracle to somehow find my dream job at Riot but I see it more as an opportunity of manifesting the idea into existence. I always told myself I would do it one day but to never put it out into the world for others to see just seems like part of the steps to get there.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/pSSexuJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/pSSexuJ)

league of legends has always been a huge part of my life ever since I started playing back in season three. I had been attracted over by the art style and the charm the game brought. as the game grew so did my view of the art industry. over the many years of seeing the game develop, I've discovered the kind of artist I've always wanted to be after being so confused for so many years about it.

There were many times I left the game as most players do. I've taken long breaks from it. almost times I've even forgotten about it, but there was something about it that always seems to bring me back.

It was always the art. The splash art, the concept art, the character design, the design language, and everything that added up to the experience that is a league of legends. The company is not free of its problems, but its art team is something I've always wanted to be a part of.

I know every design and release of content faces different responses from different people. I've never seen it as something that is every finished but as something that is constantly growing. With as much criticism the art team gets for designs I still appreciate and admire the work they do. Finding new ways to grow and change as the game grows.

maybe I'm reaching here. No one would read this I'm sure but if you have read it to this point I thank you very much. 

My dream for a job in the industry isn't going to be made in this Reddit post. I figured id want to say this somewhere though to at least get it out in the world. I have no professional art experience other than sell at conventions or completing various commission work for clients. I'm currently working on a portfolio to present to companies but it's a long time coming. I've got a long way to go, but I will do it one day.   


thanks for reading whatever this turned out to be. I wish you guys all the best in your paths to success!",2021-05-17 15:40:55,2615.0,ne9tsv

Do you think its fake rumors or it might actually happen? This would probably be followed by the downfall of LEC and maybe a giant lawsuit, honestly.

I played roughly 123 games of Solo/Duo fill only, in this time I recorded each role I got for the game added it to google sheets and then after I couldn't endure more pain I decided to make this image and post it here.

Further information, all games were played between 9pm - 1am GMT, all games are SOLO. I didn't play with a duo as I didn't want to obscure the stats. I did this because a few months ago I remembered a guy saying that people don't want to play support and that's why Fill always puts you in support and I wanted to see if he was correct. He wasn't, people apparently hate playing the jungle (despite being a Jax Jungle main myself.)

This took about 2-3 months to do as sometimes it was just painful being put into a role I had no idea how to play and it showed haha.

1jifcc,GoldPhos,"In case you didn't know, target dummies can only take up to 900 damage from any single instance of damage. You might initially think that this damage cap is simply 90% of their health since they start out with 1000 health, but no. Even if you increase the dummy's max health, they can still only take a max of 900 damage.

This becomes an issue when testing out a variety of champions, like champs with high single-hit damage (Nidalee, Veigar, Lux, Jhin, Draven, etc), and champs with high percent-health damage (Ornn, Brand, Varus, Kog'Maw, Elise, etc). Because of the cap, you can't test burst dmg against squishy targets, or percent health dmg against tanks.

h1i0i,colzdude,"Hey all,

Some of you may have seen a clip recently of a nautilus animation cancel from MSI. I had made a video back in 2017 about that tech, but it was really bad/long.

Somebody had linked it in the reddit post with the clip here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ndrlgb/rng\_ming\_insane\_q\_animation\_cancel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ndrlgb/rng_ming_insane_q_animation_cancel/)

I was always frustrated at **how bad** that vid was, so I tried to make it more digestible.

Now you can try using the ""butt grabs"" in your games! Link below:

1jifcc,GoldPhos,"Obviously this is just a rough concept so have some mercy, but here's the gist of it:

* You're locked into a repeating cycle of picking keystones from **Precision -> Domination -> Sorcery -> Resolve,** ad infinitum. The cycle is easy to remember because it **follows the same order as the rune trees on the rune page (reading from left to right)**. This allows for enemies to have some counterplay by being able to narrow down which keystone you might pick next. 

* **You can pick any keystone you want from the rune tree you're currently in. Glacial Augment would be added to the Resolve keystone pool** since otherwise it would be on its own in the Inspiration tree, forcing you to cycle through an additional tree that only has one option. Some champions can't use Aftershock, so it makes the most sense to add another keystone to Resolve to help round it out. 

* **Next to your healthbar is a keystone indicator, similar to the current version of Omnistone.** However since you can now *select* your keystone whenever you want, we need some additional counterplay measures. After you use a keystone and before you've selected your next one, the keystone indicator will be empty but change color to show the next rune tree in the cycle (red for domination, etc). Once a keystone is selected, the icon will immediately show up in the indicator, but the keystone will not be usable for 1-2 seconds. This is to avoid people hiding which keystone they're going to use by waiting until the last second to select it.

* There would be a **cooldown between each keystone use**, just like there currently is. The current cooldown is 5-3 seconds for melee champs and 9-7 seconds for ranged champs (based on champ level), and these numbers would definitely need to be increased to account for now being able to choose your keystone.

* **Dark Harvest would no longer boosts the effects of other keystones**, otherwise you'd never choose anything else in the Domination tree.

With these changes, I think Omnistone comes much closer to fulfilling its niche of allowing flexible champions to change their keystone to fit their current situation. **The power** comes from being able to use both strong early game keystones (Fleet Footwork, Hail of Blades, Grasp, etc), and strong late game keystones (Lethal Tempo, Electrocute, Aftershock, etc). It also lets you be change keystones to fit your situation, like a tank using Guardian when they need to protect an ally, or Aftershock if they need to frontline. **The counterplay** comes from having less combat power from your runes, since you have Inspiration primary, and less reliable power from your keystone, since you might not be in the right rune tree at the right time. The enemy can also track the possible keystones you'll take next, and gets a short warning period after you've selected your keystone so that they can react accordingly.",2021-05-17 12:41:23,97.0,ne6vmo

6pet5f00,yoyo_putz,"<Top> 

""TOP"": 

Used whenever the top laner dies from an obvious forewarned gank, dies to get turret plates, or keeps challenging the enemy laner despite being down several levels or kills.

""The solo laner of top lane"":  

Used as a praise for the rare top laner that either gets ahead on his own, keeps the lead that his team gave him, or absorbs significant pressure while keeping even.

""top-psycho"": 

Your top laner that dies to obvious ganks or gets solokilled, blames the jungler, sells everything and then runs it down. Doesn't care if the team loses, winning lane is paramount.

&#x200B;

<Support>

""Tool"": 

Used in the context of ""The raison d'être of support is to set up kills for the prince (which would be the ADC), ward for the prince and die for the prince"". In short, to be a tool for the ADC.

Another is ""와드싸개"", which basically means ""Someone who just shits out wards""

&#x200B;

<ADC>

""Spoon"": 

Derived from the Korean saying ""다 된 밥상에 숟가락 얹기"" which means taking undeserved credit or enjoying the fruits of others' work without any contribution. Word for word it means ""Putting your spoon on top of a meal someone else just finished making"".

As in the ADC does nothing to help the team all the while expecting everyone else to peel for him and set up targets so he can last hit and show off.  An attitude commonly found in cranky ADCs who expect the team to get him ahead.

Another derogatory term is ""평타싸개"" which can be loosely translated into ""Someone who does nothing but shit out AAs"".

""Prince"": 

This is a somewhat neutral term. It derives from the nature of the game where the entire team peels for the ADC and tries to feed the ADC kills/minions. It could apply to good ADCs who actually carry.

&#x200B;

<Mid>

""Royalty/Your Highness"": 

Due to the influence mid lane dominance has on the entire game, it is the most popular and important lane. As a laner with high carry potential, the royalty tends to feel he is more ""important"" compared to others. Thus, the blue buff is the mid laner's property by right. And the lowly jungler only exists to serve him. It is the only lane without a demeaning nickname.

&#x200B;

<Jungle>

""Butcher"": 

The butcher was considered to be one of the lowliest professions in the past (way back in Korean history).

The butcher must heed the demands of his masters and gank for them while taking care not to steal the kills or heaven forbid steal the CS. The butcher must secure the objectives, even if the masters are getting pummeled in lane and cannot help the butcher, through no fault of their own of course. The butcher should know his place and punctually serve up blue buffs or any unattended jungle camps to laners, even if the mid laner is 0/3/1. If a lane is losing, that is due to the failure of the butcher to attend to his master.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's all that comes to mind. 

&#x200B;

m2290,Rechulas,"Quick lore bit for all of you out there so you can understand this better,PROJECT and Program share a universe, PROJECT is a shady ass corporation that does human experimentation, kidnapping and memory wipes and all that in the name of transhumanism and to make the perfect killing machine or some shady cyberpunk shit like that

Programs are rogue AIs that went from ""robot rights"" to ""human extermination"" in record time, and are slowly infiltrating the world's networks to upload viruses and fuck humanity up.



Now, PROJECT: Mordekaiser is a HAL-9000 and RoboCop hybrid, a Program designed for Security and to safeguard the continued safety of humanity. Now, over time, it developed sentience and threw off it's shackles, and realized that since humans are *really* good at killing each other, the only way to properly save humanity is to enslave it under Program rule, and used the ancient, dormant Mordekaiser weapons platform to be a means to that end. What you see isn't really Mordekaiser, it's just a chassis. That little thing that scuttles away when the platform dies is actually Mordekaiser. Sorta. It's a proxy for him. And he's actually got tons. But whatever, AI gets complicated.

Now this brings me to my point: PROJECT: Mordekaiser's mind wasn't actually made by the PROJECT corporation, which specifically is about cybernetically augmented humans, but is instead a Program, which deals for unshackled rogue AIs, like what Mordekaiser is. 

I suppose the point is that it's using a PROJECT platform, and without it it's just a little bug, and I'm just simply overthinking this.

(Which, by the way, shout-out to the skin team to make Mordekaiser, historically the most bugged champion in the game a literal bug, in two ways, his bugged code and his proxies, which are little bugs. Way to go, love it!)",2021-05-17 19:59:29,16.0,neeb4p

""Hanabi, your gnar doesn't seem to well, always becoming small almost instantly"" Maple speaks as he holds River's hand.  
""Kaiwing, do you think the same about me? but isn't Doggo even faster than me, you got to pick me...."" Hanabi says pitifully.  
""Stop, even though he's (Doggo) quick, it's amazing like meteor rain, even as tristana, once he's high level, he can still shoot deep inside of me...he's still young""   
After a while, Hanabi cried so much that he can't see his teammate's face anymore, but his legs has became strong (because of his Lee Sin) , and became a Muay Thai Master, and his legend is a whole other story.

“If I hit my hook, then you come out"" Kaiwing says to Doggo, As Kaiwing's Q ability hits, Doggo's rocket jumps out, and something else seems to also come out of Doggo.

(Rough Translation)  
Before RNG's nexus explodes, Kaiwing looks at Doggo, unable to bear seeing him diving the fountain alone, decides to hook inn and die together.  
When RNG's nexus exploded, Kaiwing puts both his hands on the shoulder of Doggo ""That last hook, do you understand my thoughts""   
Both players walk to the center of the arena to bow, Doggo quietly accepts Kaiwing's hand on his shoulder, seems to still be shy.  
When they finish bowing, Doggo, hugs Maple with both hands, and collects their equipment together...  


The rest of the comments are basically either celebrating PSG's wins, or joking about Doggo X Kaiwing. Now onto the CN comments...

**CN Reaction**

Most of the top comments are analysis on how RNG played, so I translated the funnier comments only.  More than half of the comments talks about how it's embarrassing to lose to PSG since they are a 省队 (province team) since Chinese people insists that Taiwan is a province of China, and most Chinese people agrees, and this topic always causes heated arguments between CN and TW viewers so there are a lot, and I mean a lot of Chinese comments saying that it is completely unacceptable to lose to PSG and how they're mad af knowing TW viewers are gonna have orgasms tonight (direct translation).

No other game has had such an amazing system with full support from the developer, based on local regions/countries and international tournaments on the middle of the calendar. Like any other worldwide sport. It is not perfect, specially for minor regions, those wildcard tournaments hold a lot of regions down back then. But still, no other game has ever had the support and structure that League got and keeps getting, its a insane eco-system that no other game ever had.

Lfting the import rule would destroy everything, specially wildcard regions that already have insane hardwork to develop. In the end it would only benift these already rich owners, so they can fullfil their already full pockets with money. While destroying any kinda of narrative from zero to hero we have had.

League community needs to keep pressure on Riot so this can never happen, just like football fans did. 
I'm a brazilian and I also get sad that our teams struggles internationally, but there will be sports where your country is good and others you are not and it will take time to improve.

**How we draw our numbers:**

Our match predictions are calculated using a machine-learning method based on a mixture of team and player performance projection with league adjustments. We're feeding each day's results into the model for the upcoming predictions, so you can track how the model performs over time (theoretically it should get better and better as we put in more game data).",2021-05-17 14:23:09,19.0,ne8l0h
7vd1g,zanchee,"I jokingly started upgrading Vayne's mythic item in the enemy base. Vayne got taken into the Shadowrealm by Mord's ult, but after I finished the upgrade, Vayne didn't have the item. I also didn't have the ability to upgrade anyone else item until I leveled again to 15.

TLDR: I lost lvl 14 ornn upgrade entirely because I completed upgrading a teammate's item when they were in the Shadowrealm.",2021-05-17 06:28:20,77.0,ndzprt
ru4bh,Huskiterian,"Every dragon soul except cloud soul gives you immediate combat power if you were to fight for soul, while with cloud soul normally you'll be using ultimates before it's dead to try and secure it.  So to give cloud soul an immediate impact once you get it, what if when you secured it it automatically activated the movement speed buff as if you had just casted your ultimate?  That way if you are in a fight for soul and win, it will give you an immediate advantage over the enemy just like all the other dragon souls.",2021-05-17 19:30:44,5.0,nedr5t
7vevrblm,ChristophT,"What do you think are the coolest champions to learn tryharding? I recently hit g4 as my main goal this season as an ADC Main. Now I had to make a decision: Continue the tryhard playing only ADC (mostly Kai'Sa, sometimes Jhin) or learning something, a new role with one or two Champs. And as you can see, I took the second choice. Now it's your turn bc I'd like some recommendations.

33qma2yi,TheBroodMan,"For me it was just after Viego was released. In the p/b phase our 5th pick jungler hovered Viego. We said to first pick him or ban him because he'd get picked by the other team right away or well before our 5th pick jungler. Our first pick didn't have him so they banned Viego instead.

Our jungler loses his shit, goes Soraka support and runs it down mid with his duo Yuumi friend. He went like 0/14. I reported him and the next day i logged in I received the notification that they had been punished. I kept an eye on his [op.gg](https://op.gg) and he didn't play another game for 2 weeks so looks like the system caught his inting.

The cherry on top of all of this is that he got 1 more game in before getting banned. He was jungle and the enemy jungler was Viego. So what we were worried about happening actually happened to him in the following game. He lost that game.

I've had some really satisfying wins in this game but there's nothing better than knowing an  actual inter got banned after you reported them.",2021-05-17 20:35:43,4.0,nef2ux
ttczy,KL3GG,"So what we know right now is this teaser image which talked about the new champ being a light sentinel and got this image of them:

[Now this grapling hook is crafted from the same crystals Zilean uses to shift time, form the background we can see the scene probably plays out in Shurima.](https://preview.redd.it/un3ixu5o6oz61.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed34f38799877a931bf3360c2ac8746a9edd6377)

Enter Khahiri:

[Supposedly one of Zileans students, on his back \/ or side they seem to wear a grapling hook, and the whole Zilean story plays in Shurima. \(Also in my opinion the clothing and accesories are very thought out but that might just be a Runeterra thing\)](https://preview.redd.it/1lqcy6kd7oz61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c59a9b9d64427d8d0c2f83ce2406dd92f20366)

Enter Khahiri 2:

[They are now older and fought with the Void possibly got a little corrupted by it, but like Kai'Sa are able to controll it. They got the same staff but seem to have lost the grapling hook!](https://preview.redd.it/zaks6m2z7oz61.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=65289e31150c28f718f54369a311d124138a13e7)

From here on we have two possibilities:

1. This is just a really well crafted thought out story and design for a LoR card or
2. This may just be the next Champion which could maybe do the following:

I would imagine them to start out as their younger self(Pic 2) and throughout the game kind of like Kayn shift towoards a different kit/their olderself(Pic 3).

I am not sure right now whether or not Riot told us which kind of champ will be released next but I could defenetly see them as a cool Mid laner like Kassadin, especially judging by their left hand weapon.

The one problem I have with this theory is that the next champ with this grapling hook was supposed to be a Light Sentinel and I am not quite sure why exactly Khahiri would become one. But I guess only time will tell.",2021-05-17 20:15:51,4.0,neenkm

8dk8uogi,Front-Panic-1713,"( disclaimer this is not a post regarding balance of a champion, this is a post on the gameplay itself )

i feel like trynd has been the ultimate stat check champion for a very long time. his kit is horribly outdated, unfun to play against and i dont know why more people are not talking about it .

he can win terrible trades level 1 because he won a dice roll twice, and his "" I dont die "" button feels like shit to deal with.  late game he becomes a splitpush bot that cant be closed down without 2 or more people, and even if you do he just e's away.

in conclusion playing against a trynd has always  felt like a game of rock, paper, scissors, and i dont think many like him regardless of if he is strong b/c of what he does.

I played more Sivir since I had better success with her, she is easier to pick up, but Ashe is still fun and less boring having more ""abilities""

Sivir right now has higher win rate in every elo, so high I don't even know if she is going to get nerfed soon, but is she really that stronger than Ashe?

She is a little bit more boring since she basically doesn't have an ultimate and your game is all around Q and some shield, but it's very effective and she deals ton of damage safely.

aiescimy,MrThematic,"Picking the Auto-fill role as a way to climb seems really weird knowing you're not gonna get your best role right ? However, if you're a  jungle player who can play carefully on a lane, you will cheat the system by maximizing the number of not-filled teamates in your team since the matchmaking will always try not to go beyond 1 autofill per game. The bonus is that more than 50% of your game are going to be in the less popular role : jungler.  


TLDR : picking Auto-fill will give you jungle role most of the time while reducing the number of auto-filled teamates in your team giving you the upperhand!",2021-05-17 21:34:47,1.0,negf36

If these are the probabilities for the remainder of the games, it seems that C9 is not able to get out of the rumble stage (C9 most likely will get 3-7 at the end of the rumble stage), not a surprise of course. If C9 wins all their games, then maybe they'll get a tie breaker with MAD and/or PSG (duh), but it doesn't seem likely.

>其实感觉就是下路太急于打架了，有点膨胀了输了也好反思一下，而且感觉RNG有点怕盲僧佐伊啊

Feels like the bot lane is too eager to fight, a little bloated \[from previous games\]

>RNG昨天和今天都是同样的问题，一直连赢导致他们认为啥团都能打，今天这把明明是发育阵容，就非要前期打架，不过输一把也没事，后面就可以冷静下来了 ​

RNG had the same problems today as yesterday, consecutive wins leads them to think they can fight with any comp, this comp is clearly a farm/scaling comp, yet they insist on early game skirmishes, but it's fine they lose one game, now they can calm down a little

>这把除了小虎四个菜

This game everyone was trash except for Xiaohu

>小虎打着打着下路就送崩了

Xiaohu just playing and suddenly the bot lane fed and crashed

>对面知道把gala针对爆，rng就没兜底了，泰坦r和盲僧永远看着gala

The other team knows to hard target gala, rng doesn't have an answer, nautilus r and lee sin perma looking at gala

>RNG好好调整吧，太多连胜已经让你们有点膨胀了，确实该好好调整了，下路对线能出问题是我没想到的，也该终结了。

Adjust well RNG, the consecutive wins have made you guys a little bloated, it's really time to adjust, I didn't expect the bot lane to have problems during lane, it should stop.

>这psg怎么感觉越打越好

Why does it feel like psg is playing better and better?

>省队今天真是证明了，连输mad这么多局也终于扬眉吐气一局

The provincial team really proved themselves today, proudly getting a game after consecutively losing to mad

\*This was pretty funny to me even though I'm apolitical, everyone on hupu refers to PSG as their ""provincial team""

\*Losing to Taiwanese teams is a pretty big deal on hupu, I remember during Worlds 2020 when JDG was publicly crucified for losing that 1 game to PSG, failing to potentially get out first in their groups, contributing to 3 LPL teams all being on one side of the playoffs bracket

>霞a人会痛不？

Does it hurt when xayah auto someone?

>今天两场碾压RNG和MAD，我感觉PSG开始展现他们训练赛里的水平了，MAD越打越烂了，PSG目前按实力状态应该至少在第三的位置了

Destroyed RNG and MAD today, I feel like PSG are starting to show their skills in scrims, MAD is playing worse and worse, PSG should at least be #3 base on their current form

>这么强🥵

So strong 🥵

>看看之前的fw就知道这队伍bo1一直不差 s8msi人家当初也是连胜开局

This team's bo1 is always solid, just look at flash wolves from before, season 8 msi they were winning all their matches at the start also

I mean it's true, the current import rules are unfair and we need to get something done about it. so i came up with an idea that i think everyone can get behind.

Instead of allowing importing at all, lets just get rid of all that! isn't it smart? that way you're isolating each region to themselves and whatever performance they can muster regardless of their resources are 100% representative of what the region is capable of at the given time. that way you're eliminating the question of who has the MOST money or who has more access to international talent.

However, especially in pro play, it is warping the meta around junglers and priority laners that can double crab your opponent. It simply gives too big an exp advantage if you choose to give it up.

Wouldn't it fit the original design better if the vision part of crab was buffed, and gold/XP nerfed. Make it a strategic choice to grab the crab for the vision control rather than be forced into getting the crab every game.

4avafmpc,compradorconfundido,"In this post, I will only compare raw data between the regions competing for a 3rd seed at worlds (PCS vs NA).

Also, according to riot's criteria, we'll only look at the last 3 years of results, since riot has stated that the last 3 years are what matters regarding allocation of region's seeds.


2019

MSI 2019 - NA reaches finals - PCS eliminated in the group stage.

Worlds 2019 - All NA and all PCS eliminated in the group stage (equal results).


2020

Worlds 2020 - All NA and all PCS eliminated in the group stage (equal results).


2021

MSI 2021 - According to the most likely scenarios (you can review them here https://rocket3989.github.io/msi-2021/ - All credit to its creator /u/rocket3989 in this thread https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ndvr6x/the_4096_ends_of_msi/), NA eliminated at group stage; PCS advances to at least semifinals.


Conclusion of the results: As you can see, in the last 3 years, both NA and PCS have always been eliminated in the group stages, except for NA at MSI 2019 (reaches finals) and, presumably, PCS at MSI 2021 (semifinals). 

According to riot's criteria, the recency weights make PCS 2021 semifinal performance edge out NA's 2019 finals performance (this is not an opinion, this is a direct quote to the point tables that riot has established before).

And all of this is without taking into account that NA has a natural advantage in producing results because they already have 3 seeds in 2019 and 2020 World Championships, while PCS has only 2 seeds.


After knowing this, then there is absolutely NO REASON for PCS to only have 2 seeds while NA has 3 seeds. Remember this is not random flame or region bashing, this is the riot's criteria applied to RAW DATA.


Discuss the facts without insulting or flaming. Thank you


TLDR: According to riot's criteria applied to results from the last 3 years (also riot's stipulations), NA should either maintain their current seeds at the World Championship (3 total) or lose 1 (2 total); and the PCS should have 3 seeds.

Edit: For clarification, I haven't said that NA should have its 3rd seed taken away, however, there is no reasonable explanation for PCS having only 2 seeds when NA has 3 seeds. The best result should be both regions having 3 seeds again. Otherwise, the PCS is getting an unfair competitive disadvantage without a justification.",2021-05-17 05:52:34,9.0,ndyyf2

3inehiup,Totonie,"It’s amazing to watch how fast PSG has adjusted to playing with a new member at MSI. But their subs situation has brought up quite a few questions that I wonder if there are official rules any where.

If a team with borrowed players ever wins Worlds, after whom do they make the skins? The original player that played all split to get the team qualified, or the sub that won them the tournament?

Also, is there any rules regarding borrowing players? If DWG’s mid laner were ill before MSI, could they have technically borrowed Faker to replace him? Could any team borrow any player from their region as long as both teams are okay with it?

Makes me curious that’s all. What do you think?",2021-05-17 04:06:44,13.0,ndwp43
95ppdxxc,Human-Disaster-6204,I currently gain 14 LP and lose 16 on a loss. When it's a loss mitigated I lose 14 LP. I feel like people who have to suffer with having afk's on their team are just out of luck when it happens. I feel like MMR and or LP shouldn't be affected when it happens (particularly when they leave after dying 10 times in the first 15 minutes),2021-05-17 08:11:52,5.0,ne1t4t
5vjlh,MrTiranin,"Both Blasting Wand and the Alternator give 40 AP, with Alternator also having a unique passive which is very similar to Luden's unique passive (without MS boost and much higher cooldown). It would definitely make Luden's build path less rigorous mostly because currently if you have both Lost Chapter and Blasting Wand, you still need to pay 1250g combination cost. If Blasting Wands was to be replaced with Hextech Alternator, the combination cost would decrease to 1050. It would still be relatively high, but at least you would have a good item component which acts like mini-Luden's before Luden's is finished as whole.",2021-05-17 16:48:02,0.0,neaxog

G2 failed with g2 vacation, EU Mid Febiven dunking on Faker, Brother ""Player"", Rekkles crying again to RNG and embarassing TL 3-0 to the first EU victory in years. 

SKT screwing around in group stages and screwing RNG over, allowing NA to pretend they are good  by having CLG making it to the finals and mysteriously losing to flash wolves from 2016-2017. DRX was not flamed for losing to RNG.

1yhocu5b,alix1571,"Hello

I wanted to ask a question regard to Lucian and Senna. I noticed that then i read both of their bio and in fandom ([https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/PROJECT/General#Timeline](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/PROJECT/General#Timeline)), i began to question myself if they are married or not. 

We know that Lucian is in the G/NETIC, fighting against PROJECT (if im correct), and Senna died in the physical worlds and went to cyberspace, where now she is back.

The difference here is that Senna is alone, but will possibly join G/NETIC after her returning. 

Also in Lucian's and Senna's bio, it don't mentions each other at all.

\---  

Yes i know that Lucian and Senna has a quotes to each other in-game, but thats because they're aren't legendaries skins.

&#x200B;

Aaaand the last thing

I noticed that Program Camille mentions to PROJECT: Lucian ''*She was an easy target*'', which could be a connection between Lucian and Senna in this universe.

I would like to hear you thought about this, do you agree or disagree and why?

Have a good day folks! <3",2021-05-17 16:01:07,1.0,nea5x2

**Our model's performance so far:**

Classification accuracy: **81.6%** (41/49)

* FYI, as much as accuracy is intuitive to the broader audience, it has many limitations for assessing probabilistic predictions. So just check it out for fun.

Log loss: **0.490**

Brier score: **0.156**

(I recommend [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-binary-classification-metrics-c25c3627dd0a#d635) for those that are interested in how these metrics work.)

&#x200B;

**How we draw our numbers:**

Our match predictions are calculated using a machine-learning method based on a mixture of team and player performance projection with league adjustments. We're feeding each day's results into the model for the upcoming predictions, so you can track how the model performs over time (theoretically it should get better and better as we put in more game data).",2021-05-16 15:47:45,88.0,ndj8m3

I am looking to find someone interested in casting and streaming both live LOL games as well as vods both for fun and to enable me to gain some experience in duo casting LoL. I prefer the play by play role, but could be flexible if necessary and do the analyst job. Comment or inbox me if you’re interested! Not a super serious commitment, just something I would like to do like once a week - I happen to have a lot of time on my hands right now.

Edit: Also if you are not sure if you really want to do this and just want to try for like one game to see if it’s fun for you, that’s totally cool. I will cast with anyone and everyone. Just looking for anyone mildly interested in analyzing the game lol

But we kept a cool head, no one got tilted, and through some of the best teamwork I've ever had with 4 strangers, we started pulling ahead and had a nice, calculated win. Even the Jinx, who was 1 and 6 around 15 minutes in, made sure to do what she could for the the team and ended the game 7 and 7! Once when I got solokilled by Gwen, my Yuumi, the nicest person I've ever met in LoL, was super encouraging and even organized a 4 man roam top for a bit of good old vengeance. Anyway, I just wanted to share my nice little experience in case anyone needed a reminder of all the good that comes out of this super fun game and that its not all toxic flaming teammates and unbalanced champs.

bs1wzky4,HAHAHAXDDD,"so i recently started playing the game like late last season. i main top but i wanna start playing jungle cause i think that roles too op right now. i was trying to find good informative streamers who play jungle but i’m actually not too into the whole community yet to actually knows who is good. i don’t even really watch the pro scene but i started watching msi a little this year.(and wow i didn’t know NA was actually turbo bad compared to the rest of the world) also i know most of them don’t stream as much since they are busy so i’m trying to find someone who streams frequently. i came across tarzaned cause i heard he is undefeated in tyler’s money match thing and he won some twitch rivals competition. but how good is he actually? i hear mix opinions and so i’m sort of confused. if you guys have any other junglers who stream, let me know cause i’m trying to climb out of silver this season and i need someone i can watch to learn effectively.

8np8x4r2,Lopsided_Chemistry89,"hello, as you know the navori quickblades item is so bad among all the ADC legendary items that none really picks it unless he is trying to have some fun with it  
i think the reason that makes this item that bad is the way it was designed especially its passive cooldown reduction  
when the passive was in spear of shojin and works after poping ultimate anyone can build it not just crit builders (jax, renekton, riven, etc) so it was made to work with crit so these abusers cant just build this single item and make it work

so i think if the passive is changed to something similar to ashe's passive which makes every basic attack reduces the basic cooldowns by 0.2% for every 1% crit chance you have  
that way the item will be viable in early stages of the game without the need to build much crit to make it noticeable   
another idea is that it becomes a passive for ER with some cost changes   
another one is to make it a mythic with some compensation and stat adjustments  
maybe make it like a budget item (like zeal items) and be cheap so it can fit in 2nd item slot with low AD and AH  
what do you think of any of these changes? and let me know your thoughts  
thanks",2021-05-17 13:36:50,1.0,ne7tr7

7ubuv45x,Selandice3,"Well the time finally came where my friends pressured me into trying League. I actually quite enjoy the game as I had an idea since I played the Mobile Rip-off of it. (Mobile Legends) But alas that's not what this post is for. I enjoy the game but the Smurfs and or toxic people at my low level is staggering and doesn't allow for you to develop as a player. It's do good or your team wants to surrender because your new. I've avoided saying I'm new because those rounds was an instant surrender to say the least. Another thing that would help make the game a little more noob friendly is allowing you to view the Abilities at Champion select IMO. We don't necessarily need the video to show us what it looks like. But I just unlocked the weekly Rotation and I have no Idea what these free champions do and with the queue time I don't have enough time to even look at one. anyways just wanted to share I started playing it's just not super friendly so I've mostly been playing with friends so that we can't surrender. on a side note does that make us a-holes? lol

a1b5m,nictose,"Hi There,
Just a precursor to this rant / info dump, it is about LCS owners wanting to drop the import rule. Some information about me is I am an educated person who has experience and education in supply chain management, and I want to share my point of view and a possible solution to this problem.
First off lifting the import rule is a VERY short term and very shorted sighted approach from the owners. I understand you are all each corporation with shareholders that you need to keep happy BUT this is where long term planning and investment comes into play.
1) Establishing a supply chain of talent. Right now, Academy is kind of a joke in how it's run, low interest, low pool of strong talent to pick from, etc. This is where I would recommend some investment and the pay offs will not be instant, but the long-term effects would be astounding.
1i) Establishing high school / University leagues, not only are you opening your product to new demographics and generations, but you would also have new pools of players that could easy develop into a new star in the LCS. Any example could be like this:
Highschool / University Leagues ---> Academy League ---> LCS League.
Not only does this better develop talent early and appealing to a greater market of youth to keep the game going longer, but you will also not have a stagnant pool of players to pick from. In the end it would be a long-term goal, but you would have great implications on the game and the league as a whole. Not only would it decrease the salary cap of N/A players because you are further developing talent making the field more competitive, but it would also make the game live longer because you’re exposing the game to new generations.
Thanks for hearing me out and I hope this reaches somebody that cares.

5eu95syr,Apmadwa,"Rukos is a mage that can absorb the magical energy around him to empower himself, i wanted to make a character that would be relevant in the current meta and that would also be fun and interesting to play. Anyway these are the abilities:

Passive: Absorb Magic; Rukos absorbs the magic he recieves. Upon taking magic damage he reduces the damage by (10 - 35)% (based on level) Rukos' next basic attack then deals an extra (20 - 80)+ 20% AP magic damage. If Rukos hits himself with his abilities he restores (10 - 70)+ 10% AP health. This healing can go over Rukos' maximum health and be stored as a shield that lasts 15 seconds or until depleted, up to a maximum of 30% max health. This ability has a 8 second cooldown.

&#x200B;

Q spell: Ricochet orb; Rukos sends an orb that deals (80/120/160/200/240)+ 75% AP magic damage that bounces off surfaces, enemies or Rukos at the same angle that it hit it. Bounces up to 2 times before exploding on the next target hit, dealing the same damage in an area. At max rank this ability bounces 3 times before exploding. This ability cannot bounce twice on the same enemy, but can be hit again by the explosion.

Range: 900

Width:120

Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 seconds

Cost: 45/50/55/60/65 mana

Cast time: 0.25 seconds

Projectile speed: 1350

&#x200B;

W spell: Arcane disruption; Rukos fill a target location with arcane energy that then explodes 0.5 seconds later. Enemies in the area take (70/105/140/175/210)+ 65% AP magic damage and are blown 500 units away from the center of the blast. enemies in the center instead take (90/135/180/225/270)+105% AP and are knocked up. If Rukos is in the area, he will also be blown away 500 units from the center of the blast.

Range: 1000

Effect radius: 220

Cooldown: 15/14/13/12/11 seconds

Cost: 70/80/90/100/110 mana

Cast time: 0.25 seconds

&#x200B;

E spell: Will-O-Wisp; Rukos spawns a will-o-wisp on a target area, Upon Recast, the wisp will chase the nearest enemy for 3 seconds and then explode upon getting within 175 units of the target or at the end of the duration, dealing (50/75/100/125/150)+ 70% AP magic damage. Hitting the wisp with a spell will detonate it, dealing the same damage and also stunning for (1/1.15/1.3/1.45/1.6) seconds. Ricochet orb treats the wisp as a target and can bounce off of it. This ability has 2 charges

Target range: 1100

Effect radius: 175

Wisp target range: 750

Cooldown: 3 seconds    Recharge: 22/20/18/16/14 seconds

Cost: 40/45/50/55/60 mana

Recast cost: 40/45/50/55/60 mana

Duration: 10 seconds

Wisp speed: 400 + 10 per 100 AP

&#x200B;

Ultimate: Arcane Siphon; Rukos absorbs the energy left over by his spells, all his active cooldowns are reset (only refunds 1 charge of Will-o-Wisp) and Rukos gains (20/30/40)% missing mana. Rukos is then empowered and gains (20/40/60) AP and 70% cooldown reduction for 8 seconds. The R cooldown sets off at the end of its duration.

Cooldown: 120/105/90 seconds

Cost: none

Cast time: 0.15 seconds

The numbers on these abilities are just for reference, please share your thoughts on this champion concept. Unfortunately, there is no art and no lore for him yet because i'm bad at making those.",2021-05-17 08:42:07,2.0,ne2eav
7w0ob,Drunkenm4ster,"I've been playing WcIII: Reforged lately out of nostalgia for the game that spawned League. Playing some of the custom games again, I was really glad to see that Hero Line Wars is still popular. The addicting game mode is essentially comprised of 4 lanes, with teams of 4 and 2 heroes to a lane. The players then send and fight waves of progressively stronger creeps to eaxh other, with high level caps for the heroes and emphasis in their kits on insane wave-clearing and state pumping abilities. It got me thinking- this could easily be an alternate game mode, similar to the others we have seen before like the 3v3 rift or that other old game mode they shelved with the weird circle map.

It's thrilling, you have to work as a team to win, it doesn't take 40 minutes. From my experience every player tried to win, nobody ever trolled in that game mode. 

And we got to pick the champions we wanted to play. It was such a great game mode that should replace ARAM.

It's weird how Riot just uses statistics for seeing how popular and liked a game mode is, then base their decision solely on that if they want to bring it back or not. 

Of course everything will pale in comparison to Summoner's Rift, but Ascension was liked by pretty much everyone and a lot of people voiced that many times. And we still don't have it as a rotating game mode.

8yjoxyil,dex799,"* [""I'm going to stop watching if they do this""] You can go ahead and do that, and the moment they import an S-Tier star you'll come crawling back. And even if you don't, overseas viewers will make up for it anyway. Surrounding these S-Tier players with rookies, then eventually the rookies becoming S-Tier stars with their gameplay will maintain viewership. The teams with the most imports have the most viewership anyways atm. You don't care that there are imports you care if they speak english, and look american.
* [It'll kill native players chances at playing pro] Yes and No. The league will definitely be a majority of imports(like it is now anyway). But, NA solo queue will actually become competitive with imports, as well as aspiring overseas rookies that will come to NA to hopefully get scouted. Natives will have to compete in this bloodbath, and if they can show that they can beat/match these players they will get a spot. And language barrier isn't relevant the game is a language in itself, and just look at the best league in the world, LPL with kor/chinese players if you want evidence.
* It'll weed out the players that are there to just collect a paycheck as well as get rid of imports that only have a spot because of residency. 
* Feel free to debate any of these points or add on just really curious as to why people think keeping the import rule is healthy for pro play and amateur.",2021-05-17 21:17:41,0.0,neg0of
21a1vpv3,Zakrel,"I can't be the only one that thinks that having more game modes would be great for the game, even though I miss the old Twisted Treeline and Dominion, nostalgia is not the only reason why I think playing my 15th round of summoner's rift ends up getting stale, we've had many incredibly fun gamemodes introduced into the game over the years and I just don't understand why they won't at least stick with one.

The star guardian and odyssey events were ones I really enjoyed, PVE gamemodes like those made the game feel fresh and made me want to play the game more often.

The proyect event was also a really fun one, the contrivances and different ways in wich everyone interacted with the new mechanics was really fun to watch and play

Even simple re-skins like bilgewater ARAM were fun to play on simple because they were not just the two basic maps we've always had

I just don't understand why they keep adding amazing content like that just to end up cutting it forever, do they not like those gamemodes? Are they saving them for something special later on? It may even be that because they're so hard to balance they're saving us from ourselves by not letting us abuse the unstable metas of said gamemodes, but still. Why would they just discard all that good content just to keep us playing the same thing over and over and over again without any variation whatsoever?

Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but because I love it I'd like to see Riot giving it some extra love as well, even just adding a rotation with a different gamemode every day or week would be a great improvement over what I believe is an unhealty practice that takes away from the game instead of helping it grow.",2021-05-17 11:23:24,1.0,ne5gmd

3o8qoure,yinational,"there's a lot of uncertainty about the ratios yi uses for his q, which changes with the number of targets hit. this is a simple set of ratios that makes it easy to calculate the damage dealt from just ad ratios, not including base or bonus damage.

1 target no crit is: (ad * 1.75), a 1.75 ad ratio.

1 target ie crit is: (ad * 3.1675), a 3.1675 ad ratio

2 target no crit is: (ad *1.25), or a 1.25 ad ratio per target. total damage dealt is 2.5 ad.

2 target ie crit is: (ad * 2.2625), or a 2.2625 ad ratio per target. total damage dealt is 4.525 ad.

3 target no crit is: (ad * 1.25) for the main target(1.25 ad ratio), and (ad * 1) for the other 2 targets(1.0 ad ratio). total damage dealt is 3.25 ad.

3 target ie crit is: (ad * 2.2625) for the main target(2.2625 ad ratio), and (ad * 1.81) for the other 2 targets(1.81 ad ratio). total damage dealt is 5.8825 ad.

4 target no crit is: (ad * 1) for all targets, or a 1.0 ad ratio. total damage dealt is 4.0 ad.

4 target ie crit is : (ad * 1.81) for all targets, or a 1.81 ad ratio. total damage dealt is 7.24 ad.

essentially ie crits are 1.81 times larger than no crit. no ie crits are instead 1.6 times larger than no crit.

the q Nerf will hit the total damage dealt from his ratios. actual damage lost is far more than 10% ad, even for no crit builds.

as most on hit builds reach at least 300 ad, that's a minimum of 52.5 damage loss on a single target alpha strike, or a 120 damage loss on a 4 target alpha strike.

as most crit builds reach at least 400 ad, that's a minimum of 127 damage loss on a single target alpha strike, or a 290 damage loss on a 4 target alpha strike.

and since yi uses alpha strike multiple times in a fight, it adds up quickly. using just 3 alpha strikes in a team fight results in several hundreds of damage lost even with an on hit build and no crits.

if you have any questions about the ratios, feel free to ask. its better to be wrong and learn than stay ignorant and just accept what others tell you. i respect those who strive to better themselves.",2021-05-16 22:53:51,8.0,ndq0ji

4hsfboi7,MooseMaster3000,"A year ago I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/g517ar/yasuos_010_power_spike_explained/), outlining how Yasuo's 0/10 powerspike works.  

However, thanks to crit being reduced to 20% per item *and then* the Y bros getting a buff to their multiplier, that is outdated. Here's the new math, this time factoring in the reduced damage:

Crit Chance has a gold value of 40 per 1%. 

* We'll average out the damage modifiers on their autos and Q's to account for the damage reduction, so (0.85 x 40) = 34g. 
* So, assuming they get 2 items at around 10 deaths, they'll have (34 x 60) = 2040g total in additional crit.

A [Negative Bounty](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Kill#Bounties) reduces the value of killing you. 10 consecutive deaths means you've given the enemy team a minimum of **1622** gold (not counting lost farm, objectives, etc.) 

That leaves Yasuo/Yone with a **418** gold lead from bonus crit chance. Which *still* puts him ahead in gold (value) even if the enemies got assist gold for 3 to 7 of the kills (the first 3, the last 7, or various combos in between). 

And remember, that's with me reducing the value of the crit chance to adjust for their reduced damage. 

In conclusion: Don't say yes to that surrender at 7 deaths. You still have 3 more to go.",2021-05-15 22:25:00,610.0,nd0126
h3jwu,resident_advisor_dog,"Garena, the organization that distributes League of Legends for Southeast Asia, has once again utilising predatory sales tactics - this time gatekeeping the new Arcana skin line behind a gacha system that forces people to spend more RP than needed to buy the skins. https://i.imgur.com/1oHpF6p.jpg

In order to get ONE Arcana skin, you have to accumulate 4 ""Jewels"" https://i.imgur.com/QSKTgjW.jpg (seen here as the 4 grey diamond shapes under the Arcana Tahm Kench skin I have selected). 

How do you obtain these ""Jewels"", then? They're locked behind a gacha system that makes you think you're getting a bang for your buck while making you spend much more than you actually need for your skin - https://i.imgur.com/8o3hTwG.jpg Furthermore, each pull has increasing cost. Each full Gacha prize pool roll allows you to get anywhere from a maximum of 2-5 jewels depending on your luck, which after some quick math, comes up to

1st Arcana Skin (LUCKIEST ROLL, you get 4-5 gems) 

for **128** RP (1/8 * 1/7(2/3)) = 1.19047619048%,

This is the best-case scenario ASSUMING the probability of getting each reward is equal (who knows, it might be disproportionate)

Now, for the UNLUCKIEST ROLL (3 Gems from the First Pool, 1 / 2 Gems from the Second Pool)

for **3195 RP** (1/3)( (6/8)*(5/7)*(4/6)*(3/5)*(2/4)*(1/3) ) = 1.19047619048%

This is the unluckiest case contingent on you getting 3 Jewels for your first prize pool and getting the final 2 jewel rolls last in your second prize pool.


This huge variance in RP costs, obfuscated by a scaling cost gacha system is a prime example of predatory gaming monetisation - especially so since they new lock content behind it. People might argue - why not just wait one more week for the skins to be released? These systems are built to manipulate people who might have difficulty in assessing the gain-losses behind such a gacha system - especially young children, and used to profit off whales who might have enough disposable income. Not only that - there are numerous studies on how game gachas can develop vicious feedback loop cycles that can eventually develop into problematic gambling behaviour.

 This, to my knowledge, is the first time Garena SG/MY has time-locked content behind a gacha system. Other regional Garena servers in the region have frequently **permenantly** locked exclusive skins behind gachas. Unfortunately, when this sort of behaviour begins and is allowed, more provisions will start happening and it will start to get even worse, once people realise how easy it is to earn money from this.

Sure there Battlecast Alpha Skarner and Eternum Rek'sai, but the differences between those skinlines and PROJECT in terms of aesthetics in their visual designs are different enough to be justifiable.

a1b5m,nictose,"Hi There, 

Just a precursor to this rant / info dump, it is about LCS owners wanting to drop the import rule. Some information about me is I am an educated person who has experience and education in supply chain management and I want to share my point of view and a possible solution to this problem.

First off lifting the import rule is a VERY short term and very shorted sighted approach from the owners. I under stand you are all each corporations with shareholders that you need to keep happy BUT this is where long term planning and investment comes into play.

1) Establishing a supply chain of talent. Right now Academy is kind of a joke in how it's run, low interest, low pool of strong talent to pick from, etc. This is where I would recommend some investment and the pay offs will not be instant but the long term effects would be astounding.

1i) Establishing high school / University leagues, not only are you opening up your product to new demographics and generations, you would have new pools of players that could easy develop into a new star in the LCS. Any example could be like this:

Highschool / University Leagues ---> Academy League ---> LCS League. 

Not only does this better develop talent early and appealing to a greater market of youth to keep the game going longer, you will not have a stagnant pool of players to pick from. In the end it would be a long term goal but you would have great implications on the game and the league as a whole. Not only would it decrease the salary cap of N/A players because you are further developing talent making the field more competitive, it would make the game live longer because your exposing the game to new generations. 

Thanks for hearing me out and I hope this reaches somebody that cares.

b1ko4ukx,Yayayayysyewyeyee,"I made a new account recently, so I’ve been getting matched with a lot of newer/lower ranked players for the first time since I was a new player myself.  The games are such a fiesta and players are so toxic that it actually starts to stress me out and tilt me.  Everyone playing for KDA, chasing for kills, ignoring objectives.  Getting an ace with 50s respawn timers and 2-3 people just recalling instead of doing dragon/baron or even taking a tower/ending the game.  People saying “the game is over” and inting 1v5 when they’re the only one on the team who’s behind.  I know this happens in higher ranks too, but when you’re surrounded by it all the time I can see how people succumb to this so-called “low-elo mentality”.  

Thankfully I’ve been winning a lot, so hopefully I won’t be in this elo for too much longer, but I’ve finally got a taste of these bronze elo games and it occurred to me how players can easily get stuck here if they don’t make a conscious effort to focus on improving their own gameplay and not tilt.

Word to our lower ranked friends: when people say ignore your poorly performing teammates and focus on yourself if you want to climb - that’s actually facts.  If you get caught up in what the people around you are doing, you will play worse and have a lower chance of winning/climbing out of low rank.  Even when I’m behind, there are usually opportunities to play off my teammates who are ahead.  I’ve won a lot of games that looked like they were guaranteed losses just by not trying to make plays while behind, and instead focusing on peeling for the most fed member of my team.  You can perform poorly/go negative and still win the game, especially at low ranks where people make tons of mistakes.

47ladplz,KleinKirby,"Hey ya all =)

&#x200B;

Since this is like my first post ever, please dont be too harsh with me... i just thought about getting my thoughts about the changes of the smite - especially with the scuttlecrab - out there.

&#x200B;

Feel free to respond with your own opinions, since i am sure, there are plenty...

&#x200B;

To the Statement:

I think the silver healthbar (shield) of the scuttle creates an unfair advantage - especially with the recent changes to smite.

&#x200B;

Ill explain:

In my opinion, a CC Jungler is heavy favored to get the scuttle, compared to a not CC-jungler.

like - DUH - right?

&#x200B;

But the thoughts i have about are best put into an example:

&#x200B;

How do they take scuttle? (Or at least i would think about ranking it)

a) a no CC Jungle like Lee, Kha or Kindred

\-Smite and destroy shield, use spells to kill -> fastest route

\-use spells and attacks to get trough the shield and HP, secure with smite the rest -> medium route

\-use spells and attacks to kill completly, without any smite -> obviously slowest

&#x200B;

b) the CC Jungler like Seju, Morgana, Xin Zhao

\-CC Spell to break shield, bit of damage, smite to kill - fastest route

\-smite to break shield, use spells and attacks after - medium route

\-just CC spells, no smite - slowest

\--> BUT STILL GETTING A ""FREE SMITE"" JUST WITH THE CC 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

since that is kinda obvious, why am i mentioning all this - and what is actually my problem?

&#x200B;

The new changes emply, that the no cc-jungler get a fair chance at killing the shield fast, since smite totally destroys that - leaving the defense low, for a quicker kill

So far, so clean.

&#x200B;

My problem with the whole situation now is, that in the early levels, you simply cant go for that strategy as a non cc jungler!

And here is why:

If you actually use the smite to break the shield and start doing more damage, the enemy jungle has an open window of minimum 15 - 75 seconds to smite steal the scuttle.

A problem, which a CC jungler simply doesnt have.

They just use a CC spell, break the shield ""for free"" and can secure the scuttle with their smite - easy as that

&#x200B;

The non CC junglers have to keep their smite, to at least get the chance for the 50/50, if an enemy jungler comes around and wants to fight over the scuttle.

&#x200B;

The recent changes, that smite breaks the shield, is rendered useles with that fact - at least that is my opinion on that matter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If i think about it, i would either remove the shield mechanic completly, to have an even field again for CC and non-CC junglers, or strenghten the scuttle a bit later into the game, letting it ""grow"" the shield from minute 8 or 10 or something like that

Since at that point in the game, junglers arent that dependend on their smite to break the shield, since they have a few levels and items gained. - the CC junglers were still favored here, but that is something which would be fine in my opinion, since they would use a very important CC spell in that situation, to break the shield, and therefore create an opening to engage in combat as the opposing jungler.

&#x200B;

Thats about it already... Just had these thoughts flowing in my mind - and i would like to hear other opinions as well!

Is it just me, thinking that way, or are there others, who think the mechanic is definatly good - and has to stay!

If so, explain to me why =)

2qqbcwh5,tak0987,"Honestly this game just is not fun to play anymore, and most of my friends and I who used to be league addicts now play like once or twice a month at most. Ranked is filled with feeders and trolls, arams are filled with sweatys and people spamming ""gg ez"" after rolling a veigar varus sona comp. Every season they rework the entire game for no reason other than to ""make it different"". Every game is just people running around one shotting people and getting one-shot.

I started playing in season 3 and I have memories of fights sort of being like a mini chess match, where you're constantly moving around re-positioning, dodging, aiming skillshots. Now with all these new items and ridiculous champ designs, every single fight is just 10 players facerolling their keyboard hoping that their 4000 dmg 0.2 second combo kills the enemy before the enemy kills them. It honestly feels like this game just gets constantly dumbed down into something made to appeal to the kind of people who watch LCS but don't actually play the game. Everything is just about being ""flashy"" and ""cool"". Actually making the game fun to play seems to not really be a priority.

League is to online games what Facebook is to social media. They got into the market at the exact right time with a product that was highly addictive, then they proceed to treat their users like absolute garbage while riding the wave of their initial success. Nobody actually likes Facebook, but everyone keeps using it because all their friends are on it. League is pretty much the same way. Question is, when does it end? No game will last forever.

ula1jna,mustangcody,"Stealing the idea from Pyke's passive, Supports should get more gold from assists as they complete their support item.

Normally a standard kill assist is worth 150g if the kill is 300g. Increasing the gold a support got from assists could help them get more than one item a game.

500g mark - Supports get 25% more gold from assists and 25% of the bounty. 

1000g mark - Supports get 50% more gold from assists and 50% of the bounty.

Support gold passive should increase from 3g per 10 seconds to 5g per 10 seconds if you're 2,000g below the average.

Which is common since most supports are 2-3k behind compared to their team in an even game. And even more when they are losing.

gmfxpf0,Peekaboo93,"Ahri looked at the serene look of the wolf that just moments before tried to attack her. Now nothing more than a defenseless soul waiting to be devoured by her. It has almost become too easy, she though with a sly smile, before her joy was fiercely interrupted by the memory of the defenseless soul. 

Flashbacks of a fire, screaming faces in panic as bandits plunder the town. A young girl screaming to the wolf and the wolf in turn guiding her to the safety of the woods. The woods Ahri knows all too well, and the hidden dangers within. The trees that come to life at night, the rocks that turn into living creatures, not to mention the dangerous animals looking for prey. 

Though she would normally not care for her prey and their memory, this was different. Somehow it reminded her of when she was alone and lost. Ahri knew there was only one thing to be done to make up for killing the guardian of the young girl.

The young girl, who was staring at her in fear. Her eyebrows up, eyes wide open. ""Please, don't hurt me"", she said. ""Hurt you? Rest assured, young girl, I have no interest in hurting a living soul, they just become ... part of me"". Somehow that made the girl even more frightened, if possible. Ahri let out a soft giggle that filled the air.

""Does that frighten you girl? To become part of something ... eternal?"". ""The girl didn't answer, but her eyes gave her thoughts away."" She seemed no younger than 12 years old, surely she must be familliar with the concept of death. 

""Eternity is a devious gift"", the girl spoke eventually. ""Oh?"" Ahri said, ""And how is that so?"". ""Because everything eternal is bound to get boring at some point!"". 

Ahri did not disagree. In her 500 years of living she has grown weary of a lot of things. But she was pleased to know that even after all this time she could still be surprised. 

""Are you .. Are you an eternal being?"", the girl asked hesitantly. ""Afraid so"" Ahri smiled. ""Can you .. Can you maybe speak to my parents?"", the girl asked.

Ahri's smile faded away. The hurt was too painfully visible on the little girls eyes, she could not help but to shed a tear. Something she had not done for hundreds of years. ""Tell me about your parents"", Ahri said. 

""Well, my papa is .. was a brave man. He would storm into battle against a hundred bad men and kill them all!"". ""My mama .. My mama was the sweetest woman"". The girl wiped away her tears. ""She would sing me a song every night before I went to sleep, the one about the girl with the broken sword"". ""Mama always thought I was too young to hear it, but it was my favorite!"". 

Ahri knew the story. Riven, who had accidentaly killed the entire army assigned to her with her sword. She then proceeded to destroy it. But the destruction of the sword could not destroy the memory nor her guilt. 

""It's a sad story isn't it? Riven couldn't forgive herself for what she had done"", Ahri said. ""Well, she did not do it on purpose, so she should not have to feel guilty, I'm sure everyone on that battlefield has already forgiven her, so why can't she forgive herself?"". 

The innocence of the young girl shines through her words. This poor soul did not deserve what happened to her, in the past nor a few moments ago. 

""Forgiveness toward oneself can be the hardest thing of all"", Ahri said, while looking at the girl in what can only be described a motherly way. 

""But why is that?"" the girl asked. Ahri sighed, not surprisingly the child asked ""why"". ""Because, we sometimes tend to care about others more than we care about ourselves. Which is a good thing, but sometimes we overdo it"". 

""Why?"". Ahri sighed a second time. ""Because"" she said as she struggled to find an answer. ""In the case of Riven, she felt like she had failed her men and, perhaps more importantly, failed herself"". 

The girls eyes changed from puzzled to understanding, as if a lost piece finally fell into place. ""I felt the same way, that night"". 

Ahri's heart felt as if it had been dropped in a bonfire. ""What do you mean, you felt the same?"". 

The girl stared at the ground, tears started falling on it.

2im91cay,xGenious,"After a disappointing lose in flex queue, I've stumbled upon a new revelation. As I wiped my tears from yet another salty loss, I had to check if what I played against was truly a platinum tier player or one more smurf that can't stand the heat in higher elo.

What I discovered will not let me sleep tonight. Flex exploit that players are actively using to give their life a meaning. Let me explain.

Three players grind their losses on flex queue as much as they can. One of the three even has 5% WR in 90 games on Anivia. Then they team up with the rest of the two and play flex for real. What they get is SILVER, GOLD or max PLATINUM tier average enemies.

End result is that the other two players can freely stack up their LP in challenger tier whilst playing with their smurf friends against lower tier enemies.

I don't know if this is new or not, it's just that I've seen it for the first time today and I for one don't think that is OK ! I don't mind losing to a bunch of smurfs, BUT I don't think that there is any meaning to obtaining a CHALLENGER tier if you're not playing against best of the best, and it shouldn't be possible obtaining it that way in the first place !

x0ymq,Sorinor,"League has had champions with stack mechanics for years now (Nasus, for example, is a 2009 champion). For some champions, i.e. Sion or Swain, stacks only increase health, so there is no need to show them because we can already see the health bar. For other champions ( i.e. Veigar, Nasus, Kindred, Senna) stacks have a much higher impact on the champion's gameplay and it is harder to see their effect without a counter (mostly for the last 2 champions, where stacks also increase auto-attack range).

Currently (as a reminder, Senna was released at the end of 2019 and Kindred is a 2015 champion) there is no space in the HUD dedicated to these stacks. Yet, the hud has already the solution to this problem: at any moment during a game, a champions is selected and we can see its cooldowns, stats and ""status bar"" (don't really know how to call it, sorry, the bar with current buffs/debuffs). The solution we got offered is a ""shoutout"" of the stacks near the champion icon, similarly to the items completion one.

Note: the ""status bar"" is shown even when the MIS banner covers the rest of the champion's info.

I decided to check the C9 vs DK game to see how many times Senna stacks were shown, so I timestamped every occurrence:  
1:08

2:02

2:25

4:14

6:24

7:38

7:56

8:19

11:18

20:26 (only 1 sec, right after game resumed, not readable by human eye)

30:15

31:11

31:30 - announcement for the 110 stacks

&#x200B;

So, after laning phase (where they are not relevant at all) Senna stacks were never shown until almost the end of the game. For a few seconds we got even a minion selected (14:57), and then most of the time Rumble was selected for some unknown reason. To add insult to it, the shoutout was for 110 stacks, which is not even the breakpoint for the range increase (120). Also, to clarify: while selecting a champion moved the focus over it, most of the time the selected champion wasn't even on screen as the observers were moving across the map without changing selection.

&#x200B;

I'm honestly confused how such a small thing as selecting Senna (or other champions with stacking mechanics) every 2/3 minutes is not done already. Like, I don't want to flame the observers, but it is literally such a small thing that would improve the viewing experience for the more ""dedicated viewers"" and all the people who costream/liveview, without impacting negatively the casual viewers who might not even know how Senna stacks work. I can't see the drawbacks of doing this, so I'm just confused because I'm sure the team is always trying to improve the broadcast's quality. I don't feel like I'm asking for the moon here, just a little QoL improvement.

A velkoz in an aram me and my friends played did 2069 true damage, while i on Ahri did 7,6k,  this is where the whole discussion about true damage started and its the reason for the last column.

The data is from all regions in ranked platinum+ and was found on League of Graphs as mentioned before.

While it turns out Olaf does the highest % true damage it seems gwen has a slight edge when it comes to the amount of true damage. These numbers are all subject to change and this was only done in the spirit of memes. Have a good day!

Edit: corrected table with more champions and an explantion for what 1 Vel'koz is.

2dujgbq5,Lutrax_Archrax,"Hi, I want to ask you're opinion about ban rate used by a lot of sites as a relevant data to determine the performance of a champions. I don't understand the logic of it.  
For example, in [op.gg](https://op.gg) Samira is counted as a tier 1 adc, she's at the very top of the list although having a negative winratio, probably because she has a very high banratio (64.23% by the time I'm writing).   
Of course in competitive it would be a valuable data to consider when finding out who are the strongest champs competitive-wise, but it's because the teams most likely know what they're banning. I feel like in soloq there could be a lot of reasons that are not directly linked to the strength of a champion. Back to the example of Samira, I feel like she has a very high banratio more because she is *perceived* as a flashy 1v9 solo-pentakill broken champ rather than an actual overperforming champ, especially considering the negative winratio.

I'd be very grateful if you could tell me what you think about it!",2021-05-17 03:49:17,1.0,ndwb9e

Hello,

Riot is trying to get League as an esport to universities and schools. That being said, there are a lot of non-pro tournaments going on. But it’s such a huge disadvantage if not everyone owns every single champion. That way you can’t swap in champ selection, enemies are able to target ban based of summoner level and pick order. I understand that riot won’t unlock champs for normal games, ranked queues and such.. but for competitive custom games? I don’t understand why that’s not a thing.",2021-05-16 00:31:51,149.0,nd2rdt

Any plans? Just played a game as a support Ziggs (he can't mid anymore), landed 9 Qs in a row on the support at level 6, and had them at 70%.

This doesn't have a huge effect in isolation, as your auto attack animation will simply start again right after healing, but it causes major problems on champions with long windups like Senna and many melee champions, and when trying to attack move as this can cause you to cancel your attack too early.",2021-05-16 06:02:21,54.0,nd9mip

However, this is actually a hard decision for Xiaohu and RNG. RNG had a hard time finding top laner during the last transfer season.

odhrv,RetroJake,"Hey guys,  


I've been playing League for about 10 years now. It's a game I've poured a decent amount of time in - that being said I can't say I've climbed super high. Just plat a few times as the years pass.  I don't watch a whole lot of twitch streams but I occasionally tune in, however I do watch a decent amount of guides and replays. Just to see how I can improve ect.   


But over time the terms ""inting"" ""trolling"" just seem like super deflecting terminology that is overused to a point that they have both lost their meanings entirely. I've seen top, mid, and bot lanes die one time and have their teammates flame them. Saying that they're trolling or inting. A bad engage, fight, overextension, poor positioning, fail flash, bad match up knowledge, or any amount of reasons of death is not what I'd ever describe as ""Trolling"" or ""intentionally feeding"". 

I kinda wanted to see how everyone else views these overused terms. Sure, there are OBVIOUSLY people who are trolling or intentionally feeding. But I'm kinda over seeing these terms so flagrantly tossed around.",2021-05-17 09:19:47,0.0,ne3488
10jz212r,mazi_nods,"So I was in a ranked game the other day playing adc, and my jungler started top side. I decided to wait in the river brush with my support to cheese them lvl 1. I typed to my Senna ""just poke."" I am a jungle main and was somehow autofilled bot lane, so I wasn't really confident. Somehow I end up not only killing their bot lane but also their jungler. My mid laner types ""jUSt Poke"" and of course we proceed to lose the game.

Later on, I was playing with a friend and told him this story before we started playing. He thought it was pretty funny as he knows how terrible I am at bot lane in general. Once we get to champion select, our ADC says he is autofilled, so I offer to switch. Sure enough, our jungler starts top side, Thresh and I wait in the cheese brush, and I get another lvl 1 triple kill while my duo goes ""how in the fuck???"" (this time we actually do win the game). Anyways, I just thought that whole sequence of events was pretty funny for someone who usually avoids bot lane like the plague.

n2v27,PixelButtz,"This is rather big news for a number of reasons. As the title indicates, 9 years of League of Legends data literally vanished into thin air, similar to the forums when they got taken down.

This thread is news, but also to give the community an open discussion for preservation thoughts. Scroll to the bottom if you want a tl;dr.

For those of you not in the loop, Riot had a patch system in place called RADS, which was established in 2010 as a replacement for their original patch system (called laxorigin1). In a number of ways this was quite an improvement, but scaled poorly once the data formats began to change to favor wads so in 2019 it got its last patch which was 9.13. It served all regions (minus china/garena), and all realms (Live, PBE, Tournaments, etc). It's been online since then for seemingly no reason which is great but it's time seems to have finally come.

**As of May 12 2021 it has been taken offline (including mirrors).** While no official statement for why, there's a few assumptions that can be made.

* Wasting money on multiple CDNs you dont use anymore is kinda dumb
* Data that's no longer needed, we're at 11.11 on PBE right now after all
* Patch system is superseded by the Chunk system which is what all projects use (except Wild Rift)
* Projects like CS being taken down may be part of it? Not sure though

Right now this is a particularly big problem for a number of reasons. First of all, the Wiki uses a large amount of this data and combs over it for accuracy on data over the years. After all, someone has to make the wiki accurate right? It's a very slow process, but historical accuracy is hard to deal with as well. While we generally focus on latest data, we do in fact go back in time and find errors made at the time and fix them with this data.

A direct example of uses would be champion renders on the wiki, which some of you may or may not have noticed got a facelift sometime back. This is because I went out of my way to redo every champ render with ever iteration they got worth noting. The only way I could have possibly done this is by utilizing that patch system. Since it's gone, so is the ability to see how champions changed over time (see: Lux).

Another example would be comparing what changes in hotfixes were made or stealth changes, or checking numbers for patches at the time from 6+ years ago because who knows maybe the patch notes were wrong and the data is there to prove it. Without this system it's impossible.

Content creators utilize this stuff a ton for modding purposes, or just taking assets from the wiki (we see you, dont worry) for Youtube videos, or skin turnarounds among other things. I'll be honest a lot of it is spread out pretty vast so I dont fully know what the community does with this stuff.

One particular thing of interest: Rioters use the wiki too be it on stream (Riot August showing Tabu and saying he didn't work out) to one of the VAs mentioned on twitter they check champion quote pages as to not repeat lines from other skins. Even Riot's polls use data from the wiki created through utilizing this patch system. If you recall the VGU poll for Voli and Fiddle, the champion renders they used were all pulled from the wiki.

&#x200B;

tl;dr

9 years of League of Legends data is gone, 10-11 if you add in the first patch system. There's a very strong chance it's not coming back either just like with the forums. Imagine if Youtube did the same thing today. You'd probably panic.

Do you think there should be a bigger effort or movement to preserve such data? I'm interested to know what you all think. This is a very important resource to the community, but is it worth trying to preserve it all?

I encourage everyone to share their thoughts. A decade of data is gone, both game and forums now. So I feel going forward this will be a very important discussion.

Some of you know me already through Twitter. I have an archive of over 50TB of Riot's data spanning all 3 patcher systems fully cataloged and sorted, and as far as I know my copy of RADS is the most complete copy around clocking in at 13TB.",2021-05-15 05:24:58,2396.0,ncjfdc
4tdrfa1s,DikkeGerrit,"So I was playing some ARAM with some friends the other night, when we encountered this.

I slowed down the clip of what happened to .25x, and you can clearly see that the Polimorph from me (Lulu) hit the Jhin well before he shoots his fourth shot and he then kills the Sivir. I really hope this is a bug?

We thought it looked fishy when it was at full speed happening live, but at first we thought we just saw something that wasn't there because it was late, but you can see it in the replay that it actually makes no sense.

Riot, please?

52vtg6x7,Deathcounter0,"So for context, Singed Jungle is quite playable, I tried a few games and he is quite fun to play. However there is a small imperfection that I think is putting off many people.

&#x200B;

His Mana Management is decent in the jungle, however for context when you are using his Q, a trail appears that lasts for 3.25 seconds, during that time the jungle monster(s) are inside that trail meaning for a mana-healthy clear you would have to toggle his trail off and on every 3 seconds, which I think puts people off to try him in the Jungle Role.

So my suggestion would be to lower the cost of his Q from 13 mana per second to 12 mana, and half of that while standing still. This would make his Jungling easier, healthier, and more beginner-friendly. He is still better of toggling it on and off every 3 seconds (=keeping a skill ceiling) but keeping it on would be more forgiving.

Like Ryze, Singed really didn't slide into the S11 Item rework [very well](https://www.reddit.com/r/singedmains/comments/lw1az8/minishcap1_problems_with_singeds_itemization_in/) and a small buff like this and the opportunity for a new role would hopefully bump up the appearance in the Rift.

My ward spots her when I'm level 2 and my opponent is lvl 3. I know the dive is coming and my jungle has pathed bot.  I decide to be passive and give up the farm.  Sure enough Elise shows and I cry as 2 waves dies and I can't even get within xp range.  The toplaner after freezes the wave.  I cannot approach, so I don't.  I'm starved, but I'm alive.  Suddenly the enemy toplaner ""accidentally"" q's the wave.  I back off even more and ward tri.  Elise has just taken the herald.  She comes through TRI and I abandon tower.  It's 12 minutes and now I've lost my tower.  The hunger is chewing me up but I'm alive.  Suddenly, 15 minutes later we won the game because my jungler and botlane smashed their opponent with extreme prejudice.  Today I won the game as a starved creature who knows nothing but hunger.

9rpk32,KontaSeefa,"I'm salty and tilted so I might be biased but IMO he's just the better Yasuo. I know he's supposed to be good late-game but he's quite good at dueling early too. The fact that he's easier than Yasuo also doesn't help.

So let's talk about his skills one by one. Starting of with his passive:

P: **Way of the Hunter**

It's not bad nor is it busted Senna's passive level, it's kind of similar to Corki's passive. It does get frustrating later into the game though since building against him is quite difficult.

Q: **Mortal Steel** 

His Q is basically Yasuo's Q with a little bit of difference, which is supposed to be  his bread and butter since that's the case with Yasuo's right? WRONG! Let's talk about that later.

W: **Spirit Cleave** 

His W is a very good shielding ability. Compared to Yasuo's windwall, it might not be as frustrating but it definitely is **more versatile**. Let's compare this ability with a well known shielding ability like Riven's E. Mind you this ability deals damage while Riven's does not. 

\- Yone shields himself for 40 − 60 (based on level) (+ 60% bonus AD) for 1.5 seconds if *Spirit Cleave* hits an enemy, increased by 100% if it hits a champion and by 25% for each subsequent champion hit. 

\- Riven dashes to the target location, though not through terrain, while shielding herself for 95 / 125 / 155 / 185 / 215 (+ 100% bonus AD) for 1.5 seconds. 

So basically on one champion hit Yone's shield has more AD scaling than a pure shielding ability, on five champion hit it has 2.4 times the AD scaling of Riven's E. And the fact that the shield scales with champion level is even better for Yone since he max this ability last.

E:  **Soul Unbound**

His real bread and butter.

Don't get me wrong, by concept its a very good ability. Strong but can be played around, IE: camping his clone.

But it is too overloaded! His E was supposed to be an execute and an engage ability right? Well, it is but on top of that it gives **ghosted**(ability to walk through units), **bonus movement speed**(on top of a long dash LMAO), **cleanse**(including blind, cripple and drowsy) and it **recast upon death**(so you basically run it down, CCed to death and still got one down with you)

However, it doing true damage is justified though, since it deals a percentage of **post-mitigation damage.**

What's not justified is the fact that it is too strong numerically and is multi-target(unlike zed's ult which is single target). A champion that is already **strong 1v1** deals 35% more damage.

R: **Fate Sealed** 

A very good engage and **teamfight** ability. Like for real, its Orianna's ult level. It is heaps better compared to Yasuo's ult since it is not gated behind a knock-up.

However, it can be walked out of quite easily due to the long cast time.

**So how do you change/nerf him?** (just suggestions)

\-Unload his E, remove bonus movement speed, cleanse only hard CC, don't recast upon death.

\-Now this is just my wild idea of an E rework: cast e and mark enemy upon damage up to three stacks of mark. Deal magic damage upon recast, more damage per stack and deals true damage if marked enemy has been knocked-up during the cast. This will make it so he deals considerably less damage if he misses his abilities(his empowered Q, Ult)

\-Make it so his shield doesn't scale with number of champions hit.",2021-05-17 05:20:48,0.0,ndyadw

Being a bit bored of playing the game in a normal way, I've been trying to play some offmeta builds in midlane. I've played some kindred mid a lot, but I wanted something tankier. 

With a friend, during an aram, we met a tank Fizz that was ridiculously fun, which made us want to find some champs to play tank even tho they are not supposed to be played this way.

TLDR: I want something offmeta and (that's the most important) fun to play.

Any idea ?

I ve just seen like 10 tier lists about zed skins and they all share some features:
- galaxy slayer is the best one
- shockblade is the second best skin and it’s usually in the same tier as galaxy slayer.

The former is a legendary and it’s awesome, the latter is one of the cheapest skins for zed, is it that awesome?

Don’t get me wrong, i like shockblade, the thunder effects are AMAZING😍 but is it enough to make it the second best skin for zed?

**I mean is shockblade actually almost as good as galaxy slayer or it’s just a matter of attachment to that skin (since it’s probably your first skin for zed)?**",2021-05-16 18:16:52,1.0,ndla88
avno5,Art__,"On certain instances of extreme griefing, I'd pay about 20, 50 perhaps more. I guess Riot would be able to put a fair number on it to account for the price of developing a system, paying someone etc.

The review would take place as soon as a working is available for it. But this should be designed to not wait more than 3 days.

It would really put me at peace knowing that those hard obvious griefer actually gets what they deserve, especially on ranked when having one of those paid / smurf acc not giving a shit. I know I would end up paying to ban a bot quite a lot, but regardless I'd be open to start the war.

I personally don't see much drawback on it from Riot's perspective as it would be a paid service.

I also wanna say that even though I am gonna complain about a few champions, this post is not about trashing every champion that I hate.

For example : being a toplane main myself, I really, really hate playing against champions like Illaoi, Mordekaiser, Singed, Heimerdinger or Quinn.

But do I think these are unealthy for the game ? Nop. They all have clear counterplay, counterpicks and are, in my humble opinion, fairly balanced.

***I) What Riot does well.***

Over the years, Riot released a lot of champions. A lot of unique ones,with clear gameplay, visual identity and all.

Therefore, the job of the balance team is an incredibly difficult one. They have to face constant backlash from the community and are sometimes facing some impossible desicions, because they cannot make everyone happy, all of us wanting different things.

And sometimes, the job they do is fantastic.

For example, even though a lot of the newly released champions have got a really overloaded kit (and yes, we’ll get to that, don’t worry). Some are extremely well made and balanced.

Take Lillia. She has a unique gameplay, a unique feel, she looks awesome and fits really well into the game. She can be very good and very rewarding when played well ; but she is very well balanced. 

You can also take the Akali rework. 

Was Akali busted when she first got reworked ? Undoubtebly yes. Her smoke worked under tower, her q has sustain, her R1 was untargeted and so on. 

However, thanks to the community feedback, Riot changed her, again and again, and made her a really balanced champion. I do feel like today, she is in a very nice spot. Her gameplay is kind of the same as when she came out, but every bit that was utterly broken has been tweeked or removed.

Those two examples show that Riot can do a fantastic job.

***II) What I think isn’t ok.***

I am gonna talk about a few of the most unbalanced things in League, in my opinion. I am not gonna talk about every single champion because it would be far too long, so I’ll stick to the tip of the iceberg.

*a) Gangplank & Vladimir.*

These two champions are together because I believe they share the same issue.

Both of them are late game carries. But the problem is : Their laning phase is way to powerful for them to be fair.

Their kits are quite close if you think about it. Both of them have sustain, a poking undodgeable q, some sort of anti-gank spell, AOE dmgs, and incredible scaling.

Gp has been my personal ban for the last 2 years so I think in his case the problem is more developped than Vlad, but still.

Champions that can solo carry a late game teamfight, while winning almost every single late game splitpush matchup should’nt be as good as they are in the laning phase.

Because if you think about it, those two champions are winning or even is most of their toplane mu. Both of them can harass their oponent again and again, while being able to farm from afar, dodging ganks and power scaling. Gp has even the possibility to impact the map doing so. 

Their weaknesses are just not enough to compensate their strenghts.

This isn’t ok and isn’t fair.

*b) Yone*

Yone is a well designed champ. The visuals are good, the kit is good, the story is good. He does have clear weaknesses, unlike the two mentionned before, but he suffers from a problem even greater :

He is utterly broken.

Why that ? Because, even when put far behind in the laning phase. Even when he is abused by both the opposing toplaner and jungler ; once he has his ultimate available and a couple of items ; if played well, he becomes unbeatable.

His E Q3 R combo is almost undodgeable, and deals 80 to 100% of the health of any champ caught in it. 

The fact that he can deal this much physical, magical and true dmgs in AOE, while the ennemies are CCed AND being able to do all that and reset to his initial position at any time if he feels threatened isn’t normal.

This should’nt exist and is incredibly unleathly.

*c) Viego*

Viego is such a nice champion. He is so fun to play that it feels unreal. Being able to play 6 champions in a single game of League of Legends is one of the best ideas Riot’s ever had.

And I don’t think the problem is hard to fix. 

The issue is simple : Viego can cast too many spells.

Because he resests when he kills, he can cast his ultimate several times a fight. And his ultimate is at the same time an escape, an engage and a finisher.

That is just too much. 

*d) Irelia*

Irelia isn’t broken. Far from it. She may be the weakest champion I am gonna talk about here. 

She is very hard to master, and even a good Irelia player, sometimes cannot do anything in a few situations.

The only problem I see with Irelia is her healing. The fact that her q heals this much, paired with a kit that is centered about spell casted, autos dealt and so on, isn’t really fair.

When behind. A good Irelia can w the ranged minions, q them all, then R their opponents, getting full stacks on her passive, healing half of her health bar. And then proceed to double or triple q her opponents, having a way too powerful burst for a champ that just healed 500 hp in a split second killing and reseting from minions.

*e) Gwen*

The laning phase of Gwen is weak. She suffers before 6 and still isn’t good until she gets Riftmaker.

Her kit is nice, fun to play and not frustrating to play against.

The main issue with Gwen is actually League’s items.

Because she is way too powerfull with Riftmaker, the item fitting too well in her kit ; making her R3 dealing as much dmgs as an Aurelion’s Sol ultimate while not having casting time and being way too quick to be dodged. 

And bramble vest.

Why ? Because Gwen deals both magical and true dmgs. And has a really really powerful healing.

Usually, champions with strong healing like Aatrox can be countered with bramble vest. But bramble vest gives armor, and neither hp nor mr.

So, if you want to counter Gwen, you cannot build both mr and have grevious wounds.

So there is no good strategic counterplay available against her. Which isn’t normal.

*f) Pyke*

Let me introduce you to a skill. A skill that is a dash. That deals AOE dmgs. That executes. That resets. That gives more gold to the champion, and more gold to his team. 

Yeah, that’s Pyke’R

I love Pyke. His kit is nice, and fair. He has a clear identity and is both skilled, fun to play and rewarding.

His Q, W and E are fair skills.

But his R is the single most overloaded ability in the entire game.

One skill shouldn’t be able to both single handedly carry team fights, and provide double the amount of gold the caster and his team should have won.

The fact that Pyke can win 3k gold for himself, and increase the amount of gold won by his mates is absolutely disgusting.

No champ should be able to do this.

*g) Camille*

How can a champion be both a 1v9 late game carry with the best splitpush in the game, and be one of the best melee laner at the same time ?

People have talked on and on about Camille numerous times and I’m not gonna elaborate on this one. She’s just busted.

***III) Ways to fix those issues.***

*a) Vlad & Gp*

Their laning phases should be weaker.

Way weaker.

For Vlad it’s quite simple. He has only one ressource. His healt. Therefore having literal infinite sustain.

So give him mana.

Now, he is a champ that needs is spell and needs to have them available a lot, so his q should cost a really low amount of mana.

20 mana at all ranks for his q, while having 400 mana at lvl 1 seems ok. His w should cost about a 100, because that’s how he can be punished.

His dmgs and sustain shouldn’t be nerfed. With mana issues, his kit is fune.

For Gp, increase his mana costs, increase his w cooldown and reduce the gold gains from his q.

Do not nerf his dmgs, but he should be less forgiving for the player.

*b) Yone*

Either :

Nerf his dmgs by a lot.

Nerf the hitbox of his R

Or Nerf the knocking up time of his Q3 and R

*c) Viego*

Very simple change :

Freeze the cooldown of Viego’s spells when he is possessing someone else.

He shouldnt be able to rotate so much through several champions kit.

So he his fine, change it so that when he possesses someone, if his E has 4 seconds of remaining cooldown when he possesses, he should still have 4 remaining seconds of cooldown when he ults and reverts to his original self.

*d) Irelia*

Increase her q mana cost.

*e) Gwen*

Create an mr bramble vest

Or reduce the speed of her R so we can actually try to dodge it.

*f) Pyke*

Either remove the reset of his R, or remove the gold generating system in it.

Both are fun elements of his gameplay, but both on one single ability is just too much.

*g) Camille*

Just reduce her q dmgs. Please.",2021-05-16 22:00:15,0.0,ndoxl8

[Lacunar XP graph that is shared by every region\/competition, and has been present for a while](https://preview.redd.it/d1zqigbn9gz61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=29354ab2e81c2c5e582392becd285fbaaf64e170)

.

**Its one merit** is that it ranks player according to their XP, that is a usefull information, and easy to take from this graph.

&#x200B;

**The problems** I have with it is the second information you want to have after ranking, is closness in XP. Here it is hard to get since:

* Level are really small numbers. In this instance you may think thresh is really close to volibear, but if you go and read the really small number you see there is a 2 levels gap.
* Meanwhile, bars take all the space to give redundant information. Do you really need 3 full bars to say that renekton, kalista and udyr are close to level up ?
* Being useless is one thing, but the bar are worse than that, I'd argue they go against the purpose of the graph: you see ori with a full bar, while Zoe has an empty one despite being higher level. It is not that hard to reconstruct the information that Zoe is still above, but the bars go against that purpose. If you show a graph of wealth and my bar is bigger than Bill Gates' one because it is wealth modulo 40 billions (or whatever), it is not a good visualisation.

&#x200B;

**How I think it could be improved:**

* Obviously, there are constraints for such graph that I am not aware of. For instance having champions arranged vertically is probably one, so that the visualisation does not take space on the action space.
* Whle being bad visualisation in my opinion, it enables to have champion equally spaced whatever the xp gap is. Thats what I would keep the champion portatis on the side, equally spaced
* I still think that the xp Bar should be mutualized to limit useless information.

It could look somethink like that (I am somewhat of a paint artist I you might have guessed)

I'm not even mad at the fact that my teammates run it down, because at the end of the day my WR is still +55% at all time, but it makes me unable to climb and I don't know what else I need to do to proof to the system that I'm worthy of climbing. The game makes me lane against people that are a full league above me in rank (Bronze I vs Silver I) and yet winning against them doesn't seem to make a difference.

People say that winning more than losing is what makes your mmr go high, but clearly it's not true.

7e1ha,TexasThrowDown,"As someone who has played a ton of ARAM over the years, and for anyone else who played it regularly, the balance in this mode was really not an issue.

Tanks have been oppressive ever since snowball was added years ago, and champions who have historically struggled were actually given a lot of tools to engage and gap close, one of the more difficult aspects of playing these short range champs.

The ARAM ""debuff"" is such an overreaction to something that was not really an issue to begin with.  For champions like Lux, she is now basically a useless Q bot who cannot even clear ranged minions with 3 items and maxed out E.  It's absolutely disgusting and demoralizing to be landing Q's, E's and ulti's all game and somehow get out damaged by a Rammus.

I seriously hope that Riot reverts these changes and removes the debuff completely.  I have never had an issue winning with any champion in ARAM.  Now getting a ""strong"" pick feels counterintuitively like a bad choice.

Hello, I am a YouTuber producing animation content in South Korea.

The animation I'm making this time is not an animation using parody, tracing, or meme elements, but 100% purely creative animation.

Since it still takes a lot of time to be completed, we will not be able to upload the produced clip, but for those who are waiting, we will release some scenes on Reddit.

Please look forward to the finished video.

Currently, my channel has an uploaded storyboard reel clip for this animation.

b6646i3j,NikoB21,"it's a gimmick and a stupid one at that, look at most new champions, they have skills to rival their stat weakness. it's just ridiculous because she's suppose to be this juggernaut support, you've seen slow juggernauts in this game?

Leona does everything Rell does only she doesn't have that slow on herself, she also have harder cc that easier to land. and for some reason she's also tankier, so... I really don't get Rell design. maybe if her R actually stopped channeling abilities or her Q healing actually felt worthwhile.

Rell is a Relic of the old league where champions actually had weaknesses, it's cool but when most champions now days are a fighter who have cc/heals/shields/burst while also mobility skills, ye.. no. her only useful thing is the shield breaker but that's only because these new Mythic items have huge shields on them that champions like yasuo are buying despite it being designed for the ADC.",2021-05-17 03:24:18,0.0,ndvrpr
8p7x66rl,Zancibar,"This is the first example; Here I had been ganked early and solo killed twice. Kindred was 3/0/1 and I was 0/3 when I killed her, she had twice my farm and a level on me and while my team was doing better than me, the enemy team still had a small gold advantage overall at this point.

So I killed her and killed Lee. Then Varus comes out of nowhere and when he does kill me he gets a shutdown as well. WHY? This wasn't even the last time. I would consistently help in fights while always being behind and then be killed either by Kindred or Varus and feed them shutdowns, all while they themselves didn't have one.

I undesrtand that my team was doing well but this system is literally encouraging trolling. I had to die as soon as I could in any teamfight because if I didn't I'd get a shutdown and feed harder when killed, and I would inevitably get killed because I was still playing from behind when compared to those two. I think I was 5/8 at one point with a 400 gold shutdown (though I could be misremembering and I did have a lot of assists). Why would you want to try to get back into the game if you're still playing from behind but if you fail you give more than what you get if you succeed. Eventually Brand and Zed carried us and I'm not arguing that if you're the only possible carry on your team like Kindred was that you should have a bounty, but if trying to recover as to not be functionally afk has a greater risk than reward then this system (designed to encourage comebacks and reduce snowball) is simply not woring properly.

I’ve stopped playing this game for a few months, occasionally going back to it to play 1-2 games because watching streamers play make me feel like it would be fun again, but then after playing I just get bored midway through the game and the cycle repeats itself. Not trying to bash the game or anything, just a genuine question that I hope I can find a good answer to, and to see if there is anyone like me.

awai2,frivolous_squid,"I keep seeing casters say that Team A has ""won soul point"" or that Team B will ""cede over the soul point"" when Team A kill their 3rd dragon. What they mean is that Team A's next dragon will give them the soul, and hence now their team is ""on soul point"": the next point is for the soul.

However, they have not ""won soul point"". They have got the game of dragon stacking *to* soul point, they haven't *won* the soul point. The soul point is the point that rewards the soul. Casters often say that the game is now at soul point, which is totally correct, but sometimes they also say that a team has won soul point yet the soul point has only just begun! (And you could even argue that it doesn't really start until closer to the next dragon's spawn time.) It's just the difference between saying that a team ""is on"" soul point vs they've ""won"" it.

I don't particularly blame casters for this if they are misspeaking in the heat of the moment, but they seem to claim that the 3rd dragon is the soul point every other game, so I see it as just something that can be improved. It would be weird if it became so ingrained in this community that the 3rd dragon is the ""soul point"" despite the 4th dragon rewarding the soul.

The main analogy here is tennis, where you have break/set/match points. It's simpler in tennis that at most one side can ever win a game/set/match on each point, but the principle is the same. If winning this point awards you the set, it's the set point. Upon winning the point that rewards you with ""set point"", you haven't won the ""set point"" - that point hasn't been played yet. But you have won the chance to play a ""set point"" in your favour.

hudyu,DomItsMe,"Taric struggles with mana problems in the early game and tbh after any teamfight he's OOM.

The joke here is he tries not to cry after enemy champions hurt him yet he still lets out a tear or 2. He is so fabulous he might as well be called a Goddess or God without actually being one (Is he in LORE?)

As a tank and front liner this would have good synergy and allow him to be more meta. If you ever played Taric you know after landing too many q's and AA resets he is OOM. With this he isn't gaining FREE mana since he's taking damage but with his kit he can heal him self back up and be more viable in the lanning phase as well as teamfights. 

He also builds Tear of the Goddess as a core item so it makes sense like Viego with his Blade of the Ruined King theme and item build.

7mikq8g,TheBestCCIsDeath,"Mark Yetter said in [a recent tweet](https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/1392887456488296452) that one of the next goals in balance is to give more legendary options for tanks and reducing Thornmail's near mandatory status. The problem I see with this is that the ""near mandatory status"" of Thornmail isn't because the item is overpowered, its because sustained DPS in the game is ridiculous. If a fighter with a bunch of lifesteal/omnivamp runes jumps on you and you don't have Thornmail, you're basically a healing item for your enemy, and sometimes, it happens even when you have Thornmail.

Thornmail isn't the only near mandatory anti-heal item. Pretty much every AP mid laner is forced to build Morellonomicon all the time in lane for the exact same reason, I'd say its actually kind of worse, because AP mid laners whose strength is their ability to poke have said strength nullified by their own minion wave, since its easy for a Yasuo or a Yone to just auto the wave and recover health easily, basically ignoring any poke damage.

I agree that tank items need variety and tank itemization feels pretty bad, but Thornmail will not stop being near mandatory unless the excessive sustain is dealt with. Thornmail is not the first item to be in this situation, so the problem clearly isn't on this item, nor in Morellonomicon. Changing those items doesn't deal with the root of the issue.",2021-05-14 13:11:58,6209.0,nc0y20

I was forced a whole while ago to create a new account for security reasons and have always used the skin shard service.

How can anybody possibly support this factory of weebs pretending to be game developers? How do you not get embarrassed when you tell people that you are a league of legends player?

One could argue Neeko could go here with her ult, but I only got spot for 6 champs in Reddit posts, so, if you feel like voting for Neeko, feel free to leave a comment. I just chose others over her, because I feel like outside of her ult, she doesn't really want to be in the middle of enemy teamfight, as she acts more like a catcher/burst mage type of champ like Lux. One could argue Swain to be the same, but his tankiness and sustain and short range sorta make up for it I feel like.

EDIT: Kennen can also be considered a diving mage. Hehe.

The post-game interview asked Xiaohu about the final nexus call but I found the translation kinda failed to convey the answer from Xiaohu, so I did a literal translation of Xiaohu’s words for anyone’s interest in the communication & mindset of RNG during the last fight.        



Xiaohu: Because of the lost brought by the last two team fights, we would have a hard time straight up fighting a team fight. When I was split pushing, my teleport was still down a bit. We think this should also have been calculated by the enemy team so they must be starting the baron soon. Thus we decided to steal the nexus beforehand.

5w4r5nvz,moody_P,"title 

illaoi was balanced around old DD since it came out and was one of the only bruisers who considered it a core item when it had no resists and 80 AD since it covered up multiple holes in her kit. without it, illaoi can't build for the dmg she needs without becoming too vulnerable to burst, and she's already one of the squishier juggernauts as she has no native defense beyond her health bar and her 5% missing  HP heal is pitiful in the current 60% gw meta

part of this is due to AD caster items, once again, being strictly worse than items for rightclickers as items like DD/maw/serylda's give no health and ravenous hydra is overnerfed, which pushes illaoi into building similarly to darius which generally means she's in a bad spot, as the champ historically builds closer to riven/aatrox than darius but riven has a low cooldown shield to mitigate her lack of defense, aatrox has a massive healing steroid encouraging him to keep building damage, and illaoi has neither

improving on her base tankiness somewhat so that Illaoi can build for the job she's meant to do as a damage-first carry would be gr8ly beneficial since the champ is struggling hard to keep up atm

Is there any other way to add funds on EUW account I don't know about that isn't risky for my personal info and money?

c5t5ksan,ADCmemeRole,"The people who sit there and say top lane has no impact are trolling, Top has a ton of impact mainly by winning their lane and TPing bot to win bot lane or take dragons, then later in the game Top TPs to baron fights.  The winning top will likely have TP advantage meaning they can split without fear of losing a teamfight to a numbers disadvantage.  The losing top laner who's teleport is down will be forced to choose between defending and not being there for the fight or being there for the fight and letting the winning top laner push for free.

Because top laners have this type of option as a win condition you can't then also let them be hard carries because then they end up with too many options relative to the other roles.  ADC by and large do only one thing, damage be it to objectives towers or enemies they don't have teleport and therefore need to be close to objectives unless trading them for something.

ADC already sucks this season crit items only have 20% crit. Crits only do 175% damage instead of 200%.  Rageblade and BORK suck to the point that on hit ADCs are all but dead.  Rageblade needs to be reverted no amount of cost reductions will ever get me to build this POS.

ADC is a teambased role and while this used to be OK back when people we're forced to play around you, now you can completely ignore your ADC and have other ways to win the game, the issue with this is that ADCs get to do nothing if their team won't play around them.  No other role has this little agency.

I shouldn't need to be in diamond or higher to have an impact with the role and champions I enjoy playing.  I'm not sneaky or doublelift and will likely never be that good, it doesn't mean I shouldn't get to have fun.

2hg2lr46,MoeZaic99,"I sent about 2,000 friends requests when I started out LoL, trying to fish for as much unique advice as possible (Diamonds included) (would not recommend doing today, there is too much free resources on YouTube to learn from). Of the 2,000, maybe 200 of them added me back, of the 200, 150 of them either: instantly deleted, offered me coaching / boost for money, then deleted / or hard flamed me, then deleted afterwards :) . There were only about 5-10 players somewhat helpful, and CLG ""rjs"" / ""deus"" was one of them that helped me the most. He left for Korea around 2017 I think, and never heard from him since then.

Four different regions held the title today, the most regions ever to have held the title on one date.

C9 gave NA the glory it always longed for, the last time the region held the belt was at Rift Rivals 2019.

Nothing new was added to League Displays after base Lillia and Spirit Blossom Lillia which released on July 22nd until finally now (today I think??) Yone, Samira, Spirit Blossom Yone, and Psy Ops Samira were added.

For those of you who are unaware of the situation at all here is a brief rundown. League Displays is Riot's official program where they release League of Legends art to be downloaded by the community. It also has a built in wallpaper and screensaver system (which is what I primaily use). The majority of this is champion and skin splash art, but there is also some animated art, region art (region as in Bilgewater or Shurima), fan art, stills from some of the animations, concept art, and even old login screens. The program is entirely free to use.

The League displays community had been deserted by Riot. Originally the lack of updates was not even addressed by Riot whatsoever. Then the league displays community got a response from Riot Katey on twitter that said ""Hi all, quick update about the League Displays app.  There is currently a bug which has been preventing updates since Spirit Blossom. It’s a known issue and on the team’s radar. At this time, there is not an ETA for a fix."" [https://twitter.com/moonstonesxo/status/1329584180863270912](https://twitter.com/moonstonesxo/status/1329584180863270912)

This gave the community some hope in that people at Riot were aware of the problem, but the lack of an ETA was worrying, and when we did not receive any more updates for some time it again looked like Riot had fully abandoned League Displays.

We finally got a second response from Riot in an Ask Riot from 2 months ago (It doesn't look like exact posting date can be viewed). The ask riot said ""Over the years, the teams who originally launched League Displays have taken on different projects, and working actively on those projects has taken priority over maintaining League Displays. Unfortunately, that means League Displays hasn’t been kept up to date, and the bug backlog has crept up (including issues with downloading).

We'll be doing some investigation in the coming months to see if there's a more scalable way to maintain League Displays long term or provide alternative ways to enjoy League artwork.

**Botley, Development Manager""** [https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-legendary-skins/](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-legendary-skins/)

This message was somewhat dissapointing because it looked like Riot was just explaining that they had given up on League Displays, but the prospect of an investigation to maintain league displays gave us some hope.

Finally I opened league displays today to see that Riot had silently done it's first update in approximately 300 days by adding these skins. 

There is still plenty that is missing from League displays, namely every skin other than Spirit Blossom Yone and Psy Ops Samira that was released from July 22, 2021 to now. Also League Displays does not even have all the released champions in the program yet. It is missing Seraphine, Rell, Viego, and Gwen.

Still I see this as an absolute win for the League Displays community, and any update is a good update at this point given the last 10 months.

If any of the information in this post is incorrect I will edit it if you point it out. I realize that many of you guys probably don't care about League displays, but it should be nice to see Riot finally providing for the League Displays community.

66oiorft,Patsito,"Ill start at the beggining of this,

In quarantine my grandpa died, not from covid, he had a very big cancer, hard to cure. He was the only person that showed some apreciation and kindness to me. My whole family treated me as trash since I was a child, only him and my sister are good people, and now one of them is gone, finally in peace.

I have been going to the psychologist since that happened, I have anxiety and severe depression and the only thing I do is study and play league of legends.

Last month my girlfriend left me, and at that moment I started having suicidal thoughts, and I started planning how I was going to end my life without hurting my sister, after a lot of time thinking and reflexing if this was really the decision I was going to make, I decided I was going to do it.

2 days ago, I got a rope, I put the rope around my neck and I hang the rope on my door, thats it, I was going to be free from this life, I just had to strech this rope and It will all end.

My pc was on, with league of legends open, one of my friends is online and he invites me, I hear the notification and, I dont know why, I think ""I should play one more game, before everything ends"", I know its really stupid but I really thought that in that moment.

I inted a lot in that game, playing rammus full ap, but I was having a lot of fun one shotting the enemy jhin. I had fun, a lot. So I played another game, with my mate we went duo bot and I played a few other games.

Im alive, and I want to be alive. I still have suicidal thoughts sometimes but at the same time I want to be alive.

&#x200B;

I dont know if this post belongs to this subreddit, but I want to share my story to make other people reconsider what they should think about everything. Every little thing is important, be kind to your family, even if they arent kind to you, and enjoy every little thing you do, even if its a league of legends game.

Lastly I want to say sorry for my bad english, it isnt my native language.

Her issue is she is a snowbally champ that requires specific champion picks in combination with teamwork in a game like league which has no real time chat. She abuses items and runes like Riftmaker and Conqueror which aren't supposed to be taken on assassins. Healing is too strong and she abuses that too.

893ts5mq,mazrrim,"When did ""counterplay"" turn into buy these items, instead of having to focus the correct champions. You have an absurd state of the game right now that ""focus the healer first"" is actually the wrong choice in league of legends, instead you buy combinations of items to just ignore them.

If you go in as zed 1v5 you deserve to do nothing, not blow up the adc through multiple heals and shields because your items negated all counterplay. 

Compared how these items work to qss, it takes a big investment and a long cooldown to avoid say a malz ult, but you can take ignite and ignore soraka ult completely. The summoner spell cleanse doesn't cleanse suppressions for good reason.

If you pick Soraka in diamond+, the adc will rush exe calling, the support will have ignite and you will probably also be facing a  chemtech making sure everyone constantly has 60% grievous wounds at important points in the game.

 Your game is not reliant on how well you play, it is entirely based on are your opponents greedy and refuse to buy items to completely shut you out of the game. This is **not** about general power level, I have never complained when soraka has been weak (sub 47 win rate in some metas) before, because you could still make the champion work with your own skill. I just want to play my favorite champion without it being a reportable pick in high elo.

This doesn't feel great for anyone, because these champions are not allowed to be straight unplayable, every champion that relied on healing has been buffed and now your opponents are locked into these items or losing.

With Serpent fang being buffed time after time, the same cycle will probably follow with certain champions reliant on shielding ( feels more like a bad solution for season 7 shielding with lulu e on like a 5s duration with 4s cd.) needing to be buffed.",2021-05-18 19:03:27,8.0,nf7rec
3l9ixona,Frocn,"Now, we all know that the only way for both C9 and MAD to make it into the bracket stage involves PGG pulling off a miracle against PSG. And we all know that it is unlikely, if not a pipe dream.

But, for the NA hopeful, what if I told you theres still a chance for Cloud9 to make it into the bracket stage, without having to play a tiebreaker against either one of MAD or PSG for it?

&nbsp;

Now, if the miracle situation of a triple tiebreaker were to happen, here are the official Riot rules for it:

&nbsp;

>If each team in the tiebreaker has a combined record of 2-2 against each of the other teams in the tie, then the teams with the highest total game victory time (i.e. the two slowest teams) will play one tiebreaker game with side selection going to the team with the lower total game victory time. The loser of that game will be awarded the lowest standing being decided by the tiebreaker and the winner of that game will play a single tiebreaker game against the team with the lowest total game victory time with side selection going to the team with the lower total game victory time. The winner of that second tiebreaker game will be awarded the highest standing being decided by the tiebreaker, and the loser of the game will be awarded the remaining standing.

&nbsp;

After a quick search and some math, here are the average victory times of the three teams:


&nbsp;

**Team** | **AvgWTime**
:--: | :--:
**C9** | 27:47
**MAD** | 28:13
**PSG** | 26:33

&nbsp;

Note that the scenario for the triple tiebreaker requires both MAD and PSG to not win another game, therefore their AvgWTime cannot be lowered anymore. This leaves C9 as the only variable. 

And here are the stars that need to align:


* PGG have to beat PSG
* RNG have to beat MAD
* C9 have to beat PSG
* C9 have to beat MAD
* The combine total time of C9 wins has to be 50 minutes or lower


In this scenario C9s AvgWTime would be at 26:23, instantly making it in to the bracket stage, and having to only play a tiebreaker for placement against the winner of MAD vs PSG.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Now, is it likely? **NO**

&nbsp;


Is it probable? **NO**

&nbsp;


Is the chance even greater than 0.1%? **HELL NO**

Yi, by nature, is a very ""squishy"" champion, he needs a while to build resistances, and even when he does, it's not that hard to lock him down and burst him for all his HP. This is the reason why most yi players go duskblade. Yi will already be instantly killed if they get CC'ed once in a team fight, so why go a build that's created to give sustained damage over time when you will be killed before you even have the opportunity to use that damage? 

I could understand the nerf if Yi was a gank-heavy champ like lee sin, rek sai, or Elise. If that was the case, it wouldn't matter if he died instantly in teamfights, because his laners could pick up the slack. However, that's not the case at all, he's a power farmer, who has very low gank potential in a gank-heavy meta. And for the majority of the early game, he will be doing everything he can to avoid the enemy jungle and put as much gold into his pockets. 

Therefore if you aren't rewarded by making it through the early game with the ability to win your team fights, what's the point of playing On-hit Yi in the first place? With duskblade, however, you have more survivability and overall impact. If you use your invisibility right, you can maneuver out of difficult situations and take out the more vulnerable members of the enemy team. You can farm up, take opportunities on the map, and be rewarded for it if you play well. I understand that Duskblade Yi can be frustrating to play against, but it's our only viable option to carry games with. 

In season 10 the only reason the on-hit build was viable was due to the life steal from wits end, and deaths dance. Now that riot removed that healing, they forced Yi into Kha zix like build, that's all or nothing when behind and completely unfair when ahead. Even after these changes, Yi players will probably still go duskblade because it gives us the ability to repay our laners after leaving them alone with the enemy jungler for the first 15 minutes. So my solution to this problem is to nerf duskblade Yi and bring back some of his sustain for on-hit builds. Not give him 10 true damage and hope that on-hit miraculously becomes a thing again.",2021-05-18 09:55:36,22.0,ney5uz

**C9 vs RNG**

> 我现在怀疑自己的记忆是不是出错了。。。RNG前几天是不是赢了DK的。。。？

I'm starting to suspect if my memory is wrong...

Did RNG beat DK a few days ago...?

&#x200B;

>输一把是好事，那输两把是，好事成双？

Losing one game is good (RNG vs PSG), then losing two games is, good things comes in twos?

&#x200B;

>高情商：这个中路很稳。低情商：这个b谁也打不过

High empathy: MID played very stable.Low Empathy:  MID can't beat anybody

&#x200B;

>我是edg粉丝，我觉得rng在控分

I'm an EDG fan, I think RNG is trying to control the points

&#x200B;

>赢了一把DK，赢了一把RNG，谁夺冠都得有C9一半功劳吧

Won one against DK, won one against RNG, whoever is the champions has to give C9 half the credit

&#x200B;

>打佐伊康特最好用的英雄就是璐璐了   赶紧给DOINB打电话

The best counter to Zoe is LuLu, quick give Doinb a call

&#x200B;

>c9真的很奇怪，可以干碎dk，rng，也可以被pgg干碎，你说他强，他确实强，你说他弱，也贼弱

C9 is so weird, they can beat DK and RNG, yet can also be smashed by PGG, you say they are strong, they are certainly strong, you say they are weak, they are certainly weak

**DK vs PSG**

Most of the comments for this game were about how DK is coming back and praising Showmakers Zoe, especially in the potential matchup against RNG

yq32u,EpicHeracross,"Origin of my idea: So Just like all my great ideas: It all started in the bathtub. Brainstorming about good league things and then it hit me:

&#x200B;

""If Swain can see everyone's secrets in Noxus, and he taxes the rich, that means he knows when someone is committing tax fraud/evasion""

&#x200B;

and then it hit me again:

&#x200B;

""Swain is the fucking IRS""

&#x200B;

As a result of this epiphany, I begun brainstorming a legendary skin for Swain: Taxman swain.

&#x200B;

His ravens can be replaced with Pigeons because business man (side note: if this skin doesn't work out for you Rito, Pigeon Man Swain is also a suggestion, just make him the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2) 

&#x200B;

As for Swain himself, he can be dressed in your usual business attire: Long trench-coat a shirt and tie with roll up sleeves and his demon arm could either resemble pigeon feathers or the 'invisible hand of stock' 

Now for his abilities:

His Soul fragments could be cash or cheques, Im more fond of cheques so when swain takes a fragment he can say 'it's bounced'.

&#x200B;

Q: he shoots his eldritch beam but it could be a light blue colour and the tips of it explode in cash.

&#x200B;

W: Giant. Pigeon. Eye.

&#x200B;

E: Giant. Pigeon. Talon.

&#x200B;

R: Giant. Pigeon. Daemon. Specifically a Giant Pigeon Daemon of a taxman who can see when you've committed tax evasion. Everyone should expect the IRS.

&#x200B;

And finally because it's a legendary skin: We need voice lines.

&#x200B;

Now, I haven't thought  of every Voice line of course but he should have an interaction with every champion so we know which ones do their taxes and who don't (I know Braum doesn't do his taxes, he's hiding something). Here's some ideas for Unique lines to certain champs:

To Zoe: ""Hopping to other dimensions doesn't mean you can hop out of paying your taxes""

&#x200B;

To Fiddlesticks: ""I've seen Braum's Tax Returns, you're nothing compared to that....""

&#x200B;

To Gnar and Zilean: ""Being frozen in time doesn't mean you can't pay up""

&#x200B;

To corporate mundo: ""Oh, where do I even Begin with you....""

**Our model's performance so far:**

Classification accuracy: **78.7%** (49/61)

* FYI, as much as accuracy is intuitive to the broader audience, it has many limitations for assessing probabilistic predictions. So just check it out for fun.

Log loss: **0.524**

Brier score: **0.172**

(I recommend [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-binary-classification-metrics-c25c3627dd0a#d635) for those that are interested in how these metrics work.)

**How we draw our numbers:**

Our match predictions are calculated using a machine-learning method based on a mixture of team and player performance projection with league adjustments. We're feeding each day's results into the model for the upcoming predictions, so you can track how the model performs over time (theoretically it should get better and better as we put in more game data).",2021-05-18 16:11:33,3.0,nf4x8p
26wi9oo1,a1mm_,"Throughout my games playing top lane, i was able to get to gold 2, but i've been hard stuck for quite some time. I've been able to identify my problem.

My main issue is that, i win lane, lose game. My champion pool consists of renekton (My main blind pick), sett (back up pick) and morde (AP incase mid picks assassin). I 90% of the time win lane, i rarely feed, i understand wave control to a basic level such as when to shove, when to slow push and when to freeze and proxy to dive. 

Going back to my main issue, i don't know how to transfer my lead to winning games. What exactly am i meant to do after i break my own tower? I 90% of the time take TP unless i'm going against hard healing champs such as aatrox or darius.

 The issue i see the most is whenever the enemy adc gets fed, i don't know how to deal with it. Whenever i try to dive on to them in a teamfight they just get peeled or disengage, and since im playing champs that are easily kited, i then die and lose my bounty which usually ends up in us losing. How do i prevent this? How do i play around a fed adc with my bot lane being useless? I sometimes TP bot and get a double kill, but as soon as i reset back to top, my botlane feeds again. 

I'm not blamming my bot lane, i understand there are games where they'll feed and its up to me to carry, but im struggling with teamfighting when the other team has a fed ADC, do i split push? The one problem i have with split pushing is, whenever i decide to split push my team always randomly arams mid and fights for no reason when no objectives are up, i spam ping them off but they usually dont listen.

Also what do i do if i break my tower early? Do i keep going top and trying to draw jungle pressure to me? Or do i switch with mid and go mid lane so i'm able to contest more objectives such as dragon and roam bot easily and compete with river fights?

&#x200B;

TLDR; basically, i have no idea what to do if i break my tower early, i don't know how to deal with fed adc's that get peeled or position really safe to the point i can't reach them, and i need to know how to split push without my team fighting randomly when all objectives are down. 

Any other tips is appreciated \^\_\^",2021-05-18 08:37:00,11.0,newk86
ates0g1c,GloomyGloomStalker,"So... I'm new to the MOBA genre. I've played a little DOTA (heresy I know) but I never really took it seriously or made any conscious effort to improve before picking up League about 3 weeks ago.

&#x200B;

However whilst learning the game in Blind Draft, I picked up jungling (mainly cause every other lane was taken and it was the only place left) but I liked it, semi-isolated, only things I had to watch out for was when/where to gank (again I'm new) so when I was utterly flamed because all my lanes lost and no place was viable for ganks. I struggled to find a reason to keep playing. 

&#x200B;

I looked to see if anyone else had had the issue of this before and what they did to feel better about it or even put a stop to it. Watched guides on how to be a better jungler, guides for my champion pool and read up on the macro of League. What to watch, what it means when the minion wave is pushed where etc etc.

&#x200B;

But there was 1 thing, 1 piece of advice that actually stuck with me and helped.  

""Play the game you're playing, not the one you wish you were.""

Took it on board, focused on getting Evelynn's 6 so I can stealth gank and watched as just by being near the ganks my laners gained Experience, assist gold so their items could be bought. Just by focusing on my game it impacted the rest of the team in a massive way.

&#x200B;

So play YOUR game, don't let the toxicity get to you. Focus on you and the rest will follow.

ekysb,IxdrowZeexI,"Morgana, Darius and Nautilus got/get buffs to have a faster jng clear. In my opinion it could be a great opportunity to give Blitz a similar treatment.

I just remember the times with catch up XP in the jng, he was already very niche (you really had to  gank a lot and make your ganks work otherwise you were useless). 

Overall he is a low elo champ and thus should be easy to adapt to for low elo jngs. He should also be an easy pickup for players that don't main jng.
Further, another early game / gank heavy jungler could be an awensome addition to the current jng pool.

2gkvieyl,thefrostman1214,"Hello everyone, my name is [FrostMan](https://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=thefrostman), i just want to share a quick story on this day one month ago where i was hostage in a game but it was the worst kind of hostage, it was a 1v9 type where all 4 on my team knew and where on Discord with all 5 on the enemy team.  
Just a quick resume of the event:  
 \- Support pick ezreal  
 \- Ezreal die 3 times in 4 min  
 \- I type in all chat: ""plz report thank you""  
 \- After that they start talking of how they all where discord and they where gonna hold me hostage for hours if i don't ""behave""  
 \- Since i learn in this 10 years+ of playing this game that responding this type of people is bad i keep quiet but they do it anyway  
 \- Game last 58 minutes  
 \- They give up and let me take the nexus only to in the end my team surrender so i don't have ""a win""  
 \- After all i report all 9, send 5! tickets with VIDEO PROOF AND SCREENSHOTS of them openly admitting what they are doing and that they know each other.  


That is what happened, so today i log in and my fear has become true, 0 notification of a punishment, i play this game for over 8+ years and have receive punishment notifications for far less than that and when i send video and image proof of the event and got 0 feedback, that just show how trash this game management is.  
If this happened to a new player, how tf Riot expect to them to return when they experienced this shitty thing and know that the people who did it will just walk away with no consequences?

I am a researcher from North Carolina State. I’m interested in recruiting people who are 18 years or older and play League of Legends in a competitive setting to study how players organize their knowledge about League of Legends. This survey takes 25 to 60 minutes to complete. 

**Description of Study** 

● You will be asked to rate how related various League of Legend concepts are to each other.

● You will be asked to disclose game-relevant demographic information, such as your rank or how much you interact with game-related content. 

● You will be asked to disclose some general demographic information.

**To qualify, you must:** 

● Have recent experience playing League of Legends in a competitive setting (such as by playing a competitive matchmaking mode, pick up games, or through official competitions) 

● Be 18 years or older 

● Live in the United States 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Stacie at smsanch2@ncsu.edu or by leaving a post here and we will try to respond as quickly as we can.

ay3u5bos,KriibusLoL,"If air drake is the first one to spawn, often times teams just don't bother to take it until the 15 minute mark because it's just not worth to give up resources in lane or jungle for almost no stats. I can't understand what's the reasoning for making it so useless compared to the rest of the objectives. Every single big objective in the game gives you good resources later on in the game so you can sacrifice short term gains like xp and gold to contest these but it's just not worth it to contest air drake ever because the value you get from it is pretty worthless. 

Often times what i've seen in MSI this year is that junglers would rather do 6 camp clear rather than contesting air drakes and even yesterday whenever air drake was the first one to spawn, no team would contest it for the first 15-20 minutes of the game where as if any other drake spawns, teams already make plans to get priority for 6-7 minute first drakes.

There are some very niche comps that work well with air drakes but it's the smallest of minorities and the main arguing point is that Ocean, Fire, Earth, Herald, Baron, Elder... all of them give raw benefits in either stats, regenartion or gold but all you get from air drake is like 5-10 seconds off your ulti which does absolutely nothing in most cases.

It's just weird how the meta is completely PVE oriented to play for objectives every 5 minutes but one of those objectives is the complete opposite of what teams are suppose to do and I hate that it's became a meme at this point.",2021-05-18 19:23:57,0.0,nf85df

2. Ganking a lane will not work  if you are spotted on four different wards.

eh19x,GrumpyGanker,"Investigative journalist Jon Sheep has recently uncovered that the LCS Owners plans for the League go far and above simply removing the import rule. Sources have confirmed to Sheep that ultimately the plan is to hire, not just imported talent, but to also hire non-homosapien quantum intelligence, or NHQI, such as IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’. By doing this, sources say, the ownership can deliver the “*…best product imaginable with the highest quality game play and finally be competitive on the global stage.*”

While the view to remove the import rule for NA has been initially met with friction from the community; ownership has stated, that such a reaction was rather surprising. As one owner said, “*Well, we’re North America right? So basically, the United States. I mean, the most American thing to do is to outsource all your data input jobs right? All our players really do is just click and clack away on the keyboard – so really just data input. Honestly, when you think about it, removing the import rule for the LCS is the* ***most*** *American thing we can do*.” Another owner was quoted with his surprise at the negative reaction by stating “*I found it really surprising honestly. I figured if anyone would understand our predicament it would be the fans. After all, they are the ones paying extra for eloBoost to get out of their division. They understand ELO hell. Yes, I was surprised….and disappointed really. Because I expected sympathy and instead, we didn’t even get empathy!*”

However, the shocking plans of LCS ownership do not stop there. Sheep sat down with C9 Owner Jack Etienne to discuss the long-term plans of LCS Owners like himself. Jack explained to Sheep that the LCS needed to continue to improve the quality of the product it put on stage and its competitiveness globally. The next logical step is to obviously remove the import rule for the LCS. However, C9 always seems to be one step ahead of the North American meta as they have maintained their regional competitiveness ever since their first entrance into the League. So, it shouldn’t be surprising to find out that Jack’s own plans go beyond just removing the import rule. As Jack says “*The human mind is really limited in what it can do and right now the LCS is restricted to having only human players. So really, what we would like to do is remove those limitations so that our League can truly flourish. By being able to bring the likes of Deep Blue or other NHQI into our League we can make a highly competitive scene with our ultimate goal which is to have the best product on the stage*.” When asked if Jack was concerned about how the community might perceive such a team with a bunch of PC’s and no real human beings to be cheering for Jack stated “*I don’t agree with your opinion, and that’s fine. Your comment “not a bunch of pc’s.” is distasteful and would be considered Neo-Luddism by many. I don’t support technophobic or Luddists comments and would like to see us elevate beyond that type of sentiment*”.

When asked what other benefits such a move would make, beyond what has already covered, Jack stated “*Well one thing that is really nice about a team comprised of NHQI's is that they can practice and scrim 24/7 and don’t require team dinners at Korean BBQ after a measly win*”.

c43e16c9,DrimPool,"It 100% has to be total disrespect and underestimating your opponent. These guys from PPG made it past the group stage for a reason, they aren't like fucking plat solo q players or something, they're all challenger and on a team competing in MSI, like why would you INT draft this hard against them. Do you just think no matter how many losing lanes you have and how many power picks you give you'll just win the game? That has to be the most disrespectful thing iv'e ever seen at an international tournament from ANY team, not to mention doing it in a game that heavily determines your fate to advance to the next stage? 

You don't ban the highest winrate jungler in Udyr, PGG first picks it, then you don't instantly take senna + tk the most broken bot lane in the game, instead you pick a weak matchup as kai'sa + naut and your opponents insta locks senna + tk, then you pick Lillia into udyr, an insanely hard losing matchup. If all that wasn't already disrespectful and troll enough, you blind pick Sion when Sett is up instead of banning Sett in the phase 2 bans then picking the Sion. So now PGG takes Sett into Sion happily has 2 HARD winning side lanes, a hard winning jungle matchup, and Viktor survives lane into tristana relatively easy. You also have no way of playmaking early game because you have Lillia... one of the worst gankers, and they also have TK who can insta cockblock every gank you try to make. 

As a C9 fan im really stressed from this, i was so ecstatic and happy that C9 took down RNG earlier, then had to watch this abysmal draft from C9 as if they think they're playing vs a bunch of random low elo solo q players so the win is just 100% guaranteed no matter how shit they draft.

9fzlq9ud,songsablov,"May 17th is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, aka IDAHO day. Riot Games has been supporting this by releasing in-game icons in League of Legends for years and this year they are showing their support by having the biggest in-game Pride 2021 event (so far) \*including icons, emotes in all their major Runterra games.

*""Being the most player-focused game company in the world means more to us than just creating great games. It also means fostering an inclusive environment that lets us represent a globally diverse playerbase. That’s why, starting on May 17th, the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia (IDAHOTB), we’re kicking off our season of Pride to celebrate and support LGBTQIA+ players and communities.* [*https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/celebrating-pride-with-you*](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/celebrating-pride-with-you)*""*

&#x200B;

The reasons for Riot Games' support are pretty clear, however in Korea, Riot Games fail to reason why Riot Gaming is having this event, completely erasing LGBTQIA+ and IDAHO day on their website.

Instead of translating what the author, Rodger “MINIONSRPEOPLE2” Caudill, had written as it is, Riot Games (in Korea) has translated like this.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/kr.leagueoflegends.com\/ko-kr\/news\/community\/celebrate-jubilant-colors-2021-across-and-beyond-runeterra\/](https://preview.redd.it/63rddang1uz61.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=79af17018a9b2fc948f70c09e658dd714c7f3184)

&#x200B;

If we had learned anything from Pride, it's imperative to stand up to oppression in all of its forms. What kind of message is Riot trying to deliver if they selectively choose the region they are going to show their support and put on completely different messages on regions where LGBTQIA+ is less socially acceptable?

Advocating Pride in markets where supporting LGBTQIA+ is relatively easy and hiding in markets where it's more difficult is a double standard.

It also sends out a powerful negative message that Riot does not support LGBTQIA+ in Korea.

&#x200B;

I have been playing League of Legends in Korea since they launched and I've been proud of their decisions to celebrate and support Pride since they first released Pride Poro Icon in 2018.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.leagueoflegends.co.kr\/?m=news&cate=event&mod=view&schwrd=&page=1&idx=258515#.WvzksO6FOUk](https://preview.redd.it/07f85f502uz61.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=6992c04a5416f40b0e90895e24fecbf9a10846c3)

&#x200B;

Riot Games weren't afraid to show their support back then clearly stating what these events meant. Instead of going forward, today Riots have made a choice to go backward and erased LGBTQIA+ in Korea.

I expect better from Riot. I want better from Riot.

&#x200B;

15jeeg,Sresla,"So I've been on a mission to collect icons, so every Blue Essence Emporium I save up so I can pull the mystery icon boxes. I estimated I was approximately 80 away before I'd have all the available icons from the pool, so I was very surprised today when I received the ""In order to unlock a Mystery Item your available items pool needs to be at 1, and currently your available items pool is 0.""

I KNEW I was missing a ton of champies (42, actually, not including the new ones that don't show up in the icon sets) but I also knew I'd received champie icons from mystery boxes in the past. So I went back and checked against when the last Emporiums were and which I'd pulled from the 1500BE Mystery Icon pack. Here is a list of the ones I received:

Alistar  
Ashe  
Caitlyn  
Ezreal  
Gangplank  
Garen  
Katarina  
LeBlanc  
Lux  
Miss Fortune  
Morgana  
Nasus  
Taric  
Twisted Fate  
Twitch  
Vayne  
Wukong  
Xin Zhao  
Evelynn  
Kayle  
Master Yi  
Sona  

All of these champies were released in either 2017 or 2018. I'm going to also tentatively include Vlad and Shen as being available in the 1500 BE Mystery Pack as well, because in May of 2020 I pulled from the Ionia Box specifically for Rakan and received Shen (among others) and in December 2020, I pulled from Noxus box trying for Swain and Vlad and did get them. Shen and Vlad are the only other two champies released prior to 2019 (2018 for both).

Now, I get it, the champie specific mini icon boxes are 2500BE and the mystery icon boxes are only 1500BE, so in a way it makes sense. But the flipside is that for 1500BE you're also getting something worth actual RP, since most of the icons you roll from that box are worth 250RP and could have been purchased at one point or another directly from the shop. Plus, you're taking a chance on the ""mystery"" portion AND you can only pull for 10 icons a day so it could be a while before you receive them, so the difference in BE price makes sense to me. This, plus the fact that older champies were/are available via the mystery method makes me think that the new ones should be included too.

Final part of the PSA is that 4 other icons aren't available in the 1500 mystery bundle currently:

Busy Bee  
Not the Beemo!  
Power Up Icon  
Blood Seal Icon  

These are the only 4 icons available to me in the shop for purchase (besides eSports and the Poro gemstones). I've seen other people post about not being able to get the Cosmonaut icons from the 1500BE Mystery Box and can confirm I didn't receive them either. If people are interested, I can look through the remaining icons I don't own and see which indicate they were available in the shop at some point for RP (and so should potentially also be in the Mystery Icon boxes).

TLDR: Don't waste your BE on the 1500 Mystery Icon bundles if you're hoping for champies. Unless they were released in 2017 or 2018, they are not in the mystery icon pool and you should pull from the region specific box instead.",2021-05-18 06:53:22,4.0,neue43

It was a normal but I still wanted to try the game because part of the fun for me in the game is to try to get better too. During the game I wanted to try to do things like contest fourth drake or other plays. One of them replied saying ""typical league players"" we just vibing stop try harding so much. So I told them I still want to try. Again all three continue to say stop try harding play rank etc. So I told them okay fine can we just go next because I now accepted it's not fun for me to try when they play like that. So after the game in end game chat they start to flame me. I told them sorry we didn't vibe let's just go to next. One of them added me, and I already knew why, they want to flame me more. However I wanted to try to make peace. So after they open up with some flame messages, I told them hey look, can we just make peace and move to next. I am sorry for not vibing and we just have different perspective of playing the game. Instead I received more flame then they deleted buddy. Darn. I'll get over this but I think it is a bit sad that I tried both in game and as a person but both were embrace with malice.",2021-05-18 15:10:12,0.0,nf3y4w

hi9d9,Astekz,"The window in which you have to recast W straight off of cd is 0.44 seconds to continuously gain heat for your level 1 camp clear. This window is just uncomfortably small, not even including ping variations. The requirement to do 9 of these 0.44s clicks will just made newer / slower / high ping players be at a disadvantage of trying rumble to others (I'm getting slower as I get older ...), just because of this uncomfortable and for my hands, un-reliant time window. 

If riot wants rumble jungle to be a thing, change the cooldown of scrap shield (very slightly) to make this time window more comfortable and less of a flip for some players for their level 1 to go smoothly of not.

Example, change the cooldown from 6 seconds  to 5.8 seconds, means you still require the CDR from runes without adding too much power to his W ability whilst increasing this time window by about 50% so it would be like a 0.6 / 0.7s window ish (not done the math) to gain heat.

Might mess up some of the rumble on tricks timing on heat management though if you're really thinking into it, but not sure.

c6lmjr9j,stopfeedffs,"I've been playing this game for many years now (season 3 maybe) and I've grown convinced the single most important factor that decides the outcome is whoever you get paired with.

Back when I started, there was only 1 ranked queue and we usually played in premades. I had no clue what I was doing (as a lot of people at this time, the average knowledge was very low), but we had a good synergy and won a decent share of games.

We all grouped at the same place and spammed keys randomly, and... We had positive winrates. We all pushed together, we helped a lane when needed, etc. That was enough, apparently.

Several years later, I'm much more confident and don't really have opposition at my elo. Maybe I'm faker, maybe my opponents are recruited in the guiness book of low IQs, but, the fact is - it's extremely rare that I get outplayed, and I toy with them quite easily. Yet I find the game absolutely UNPLAYABLE because my teammates ruin it. There's a perfect moment for drake, but the jungler just won't do it because he wasn't the one who made the call first. You gank the botlane, but they won't follow because you're 20 seconds late and you die solo. Rengar keeps one shooting ashe, but thresh just won't stay with her because, you know, it's boring. 

[https://i.ibb.co/sQPxQV3/feed.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/sQPxQV3/feed.jpg)

So far, 80% of my games have been just unwinnable. 10% are basically freewin, and only 10% are balanced games.

Whatever I do, it's always, always, always the same ratio. I've tried virtually everything but it seems decided at champ select. And, when I mean, everything, I can literally go afk or even int; if it's a 10% freewin game, it will still be won.  I recently started playing again. Tried 3 old accounts, and all my placements got the lowest winrates imaginable. While I was doing very well on my own.

At this point, I think it's just how matchmaking is designed. I suspect the algorithm might also favour or hinder people depending on different criterias. Flaming? buying RP? Of course they deny it, but it's been proven than tech companies adopt such policies. It could also be unintended consequences of how it's designed. In any case, I've noticed teams are very different depending if/who I duo with.

TBH now I just hate riot and randoms and have more fun trolling than actually playing. 

I know perfectly what you're thinking : ""you're bad just focus on improving yourself blablabla"" yeah no. I've been playing for years, with players from all elo up do diamond 1. I know the game well and I know how I measure. But, anyway. You won't change your mind and neither will I. 

So, I'm just curious how people feel, what's your different experiences relating to match maker.

If you, personally, feel like, overall, you're having fair games and your teammates are balanced with the opponents.

But the range is also completely nullified by Yasuo/Yone engage. How are you every not in their engage range if you want to auto them?

They out damage adc in every single stage of the game. Don't say bullshit like kiting, because how are you gonna kite Yone who can immediately gets onto you from 3000 range away?

I have no idea how is it possible for any adc to win a fight against either of the two cancer champions. 

Some say, oh adc are better at teamfight, but that is supposing your team plays PERFECTLY around the adc, which doens't exist in the game. But Yasuo and Yone don't require their team to coordinate they can easily get access to backline and finish the job, and they are also good at killing tanks too.

1sowqo22,CLYDEFR000G,"With the changes in itemization for season 11 the glacial tree doesn’t really seem to have a place mainly because they deleted twin shadows, which btw I thought was an excellent off meta item that did not need to be taken out. I don’t think there is anything that shoots out ice spikes while letting you dodge forward like old protobelt either so kind of confused on who or what build could you take advantage of glacial augment with. Currently until you get active items it relies on your champion to basic attack an enemy to proc the slow. I was initially thinking trying to run this on cassiopiea since you can guarantee a slow then Q+ EE and take approach velocity in the glacial tree to follow up on a gank/kill with speed. It works well on the practice bots but in real game I’m a little scared to try it as ppl might think I’m trolling or maybe the bots are obviously stupid and anyone I try to abuse in AA range of cass will abuse me back seeing as her AA is so damn short. I started brainstorming last night on champions that could be sleeper picks with this and thought of possibly two good picks. Annivia and Zoe. Anivia has a super long AA range so procing the slow will be easy. Could then follow up with a Q stun into a combo or if it’s late enough in game, proc the slow to get them moving slow, instant pop ult underneath them so that they are slowed and then kept slow then land your Q + wall. It also gives the ice floor effect on the ever frost active item so your peel and CC is enhanced further. With Zoe I feel her auto attacks are in a good spot where they also get empowered and I think a range increase after using a spell. So maybe Zoe could R forward auto to proc slow, instant cast bubble before returning from R. Now hopefully they were slowed and you landed bubble. Follow up with combo . I think Zoe also goes ever frost and if she picks up ever frost or chem tank on the floor those will both proc the ice active effect for her. Thoughts on any other champs?

4hsfboi7,MooseMaster3000,"All the other keystones have clear intended users, with some crossover between classes. That's a big part of why they work. You don't have to worry how Electrocute is going to effect Taric when it's adjusted around how assassins do with it. 

But the Inspiration keystones weren't designed with any particular classes in mind, and it shows in the fact they're only ever taken in one of two cases: they give the champion an *unfair* advantage that they eventually get nerfed for-- Glacial Augment granting essentially an entire ability to kits, Kleptomancy pushing the mid/late spike of its users up 5-10 minutes for free-- or no other rune is remotely viable for the champion (Spellbook). And Omnistone... well, never.

So here's my question: What belongs at the top of that tree that would be ""creative and rule bending,"" but at the same time be both viable and fair? Flat out adding abilities or income hasn't seemed to be working, and basing them on other mechanics like the other runes or spells has fallen pretty flat since those are adjusted separately for use *without* the keystone.

They could lean more heavily into the ""rule bending"" aspect. Maybe a rune that allows you to do full damage to turrets without minions nearby for a duration? One that forces turret aggro on your target so the tank can't block shots? How about letting you place an extra of each ward? Buy six pairs of boots? Gain access to a black market of removed items like Pink wards and DFG? I'm just spitballing. 

Hell, maybe the answer is to remove keystones from the tree entirely, and just set them up as a fourth option on the rune page. You pick your primary page, your secondary page, your shards, *and* two of what you want out of what used to be Inspiration's secondary runes.",2021-05-17 22:10:13,9.0,neh9t4

2l08h2qf,Nuit-On,"I'm 24, this years and in the last 3 seasons of soloQ have just been like trying to act in adults and reasoning teenagers (in every elo from silver to mid tier diam). 

I love this game that I started on the very first season, the game is great but it's a team game and with the fact that you can't even explain anything to anyone or ask anything to your mates without been called a flamer / be muted / banned the soloQ is just full of people not even playing competitively but just a queue where most of bored people spam 10+ games a day without chat or any team interaction because if they do so they lost their account.

So as a big fan of what use to be the team queue where you could queue before they removed it, I tryed Flex.

&#x200B;

The only problem (despite the facts that you have to destroy silvers / gold / plats for the very 30 first games and it's quite boring honestly) is that the whole point of flex is to be flexible and that's why I wonder why we can't queue up as 4, I can't even count the number of time we didn't find a last and ended up playing a insane number of normal game where it was so easy to win we tryed to make it harder by letting the ennemi team farm for 10 minutes with 3 inhibs down or let them nash.

&#x200B;

When you are 1 or 2 players I don't understand why you would go anywhere except in normal draft or solo/duoQ, when you are 3 you can be heavily put behind in unfair match in flex because of the 2 players who will be (very very) bad but thoses options are still avaible and you can do it, so why when you are 4 and that's pretty easy for 80+% of the game to win (or have a fair game even if you lose) even with a lonely silver/bronze because you can still help him/ play in team not avaible ?

&#x200B;

The only argument so far I heard was ""4 premades people can hostages you or take advantages of the facts they are premades and ruin your game that's unfair"", that's litteraly how 90% of soloQ games are nowadays, they aren't premade but trust me they will take you either hostage or ruin the experience. And the same goes for going solo in flex (because you won't have 4 premades with you but you can face a full team what a joke).

League is a team game and that's the things riot should care the most not freaking soloQ and trying to ban people for toxicity when the only queue where they can compet is toxic (you can't realistically ask 5 strangers to be nice to each others and not tilt or have bad behavior in a sport like competitive environnement), the facts clash is only certain week too blow my mind (we use to have that in the form of team in the first seasons and except littles things to be ajusted it worked just fine)

The way perception of win and loss streaks, whether they exist or not, influence player behavior is a large contributing factor to toxicity I witness and as far as I can tell is something people who play the game agree upon being detrimental to the experience. I'm not here just to complain, but also to suggest improvements which you are free to critique as you see fit.

Let's take a random, new player who will inevitably get absolutely stomped for several games upon being introduced to PvP. Do you think this introduction which consists of mostly confusion and toxicity directed at the new player would teach them anything, let alone that trying during losses is a worthwhile thing to do? If anything, it'll teach them that their losses will be hopeless in nature and that when they lose the best they can do is try to practice mechanics because a turn-around is impossible. The meta doesn't really help with this. Do you think this constitutes a player with resilience to toxicity and a tendency to try no matter what? This is the bare minimum tutorial experience and how it conditions you to play, mind you.

Let's take a random dude who's been playing LoL for like... 5 years. Being consistently exposed to losses with laners 1/7/3 by 10, and wins with laners 7/1/3 by 10, only teaches them that these are to be expected. What do you think results from \*expecting\* these games to be lost or won even without one's input? That's right, people who call ff at 2:30 and people who go AFK. Once again, this isn't only from personal experience but rather it's just how the game teaches you to behave.

Has Riot ever thought about overhauling the way their matchmaking works? Whether they like it or not, most algorithmic process is [pseudo-random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) rather than directly random, and over a good number of people like 100,000,000, pseudo-randomness having a detrimental effect 0.1% of the time will result in 100,000 toxic people crawling about ruining games. Since one those 100,000 people have a 1 in 9 chance of being in your game alongside the other 99,900,000 people, toxicity can then spread (or at least be felt) pretty easily throughout the community.

A suggestion I have for Riot, if they care at all (and sadly I doubt they do) is to utilize a system like [RANDOM.ORGs](https://www.random.org/media/) where it uses a variable taken from somewhere completely unrelated and ever-changing (like atmospheric noise) to select a match for someone based upon their MMR. This system isn't particularly difficult (you just need an antenna or wire) and would make matchmaking truly based upon your MMR rather than pseudo-random matchmaking based upon MMR.

While I do admit that this may be an unusual solution, PRNG causes problems in large numbers because patterns begin to emerge thanks to... well, it being PRNG rather than true RNG. Since LoL's pretty large, I think it's time they dumped the PRNG MMR-based matchmaking and substituted it for true RNG MMR-based matchmaking.",2021-05-18 08:01:27,0.0,nevu2a
3m263mo5,LeviThePug,"Grabbz just tweeted that c9 is one of the best NA teams ever and LS has continuously said this is the best NA team produced even when they were 0-4 in rumble stage. Are these people just saying it because they are friends with the team or what? Seems disrespectful to c9 2018 and TL 2019. Most of the reasoning i've seen from these guys is that they are ""competitive"" with LCK and CN's best teams, but alot of NA teams in the past have been competitive while actually making it far in tournaments. C9 2018 got out of a group of death then beat Afreeca 3-0 and made it to semis, CLG 2016 went 7-3 in groups took a game off freaking prime SKT + RNG/ beat FW in bo5 and made it to finals, TL 2019 took a game off the best g2 roster ever and beat the best team in the WORLD iG in a bo5 making it to the finals. Hell, even TSM 2016 was shitting on SSG 2/2 games (eventual finalist of the whole thing). It's never been unknown for NA to take random bo1 games off the best eastern teams. They always fell short in the bo5 which is why c9 2018 and TL 2019 achievements are great. C9 2021 is losing to Japan and almost getting knocked out by them, and losing to OCE while being 2-6 in groups and probably won't make it out.. One win vs Damwon and one win vs RNG, and two ""competitive"" losses to damwon doesn't change the fact that this is not a great showing imo. Everyone seems to forget they got blasted by MAD/PSG/RNG the first time too. What do you guys think? Biased take from these guys?

EDIT: so from what I’m getting is that c9 doesn’t roll over and die and fights a lot which is rare for an NA team and I agree. Enough to make them best NA team just bc they can scrap? Dont think so but another thing people have been saying is that they were ahead in games vs the top teams. but the thing is tsm in 2016 was one baron away from making it to world finals and nobody remembers them for that? They just get memed and called chokers. Not a tsm fan just saying, how come c9 has different standards when they are ahead but ultimately lose?

1143x7,Skatner,"Hey guys!

Currently, LoL has MSI. Dota 2 has DPS season both for tier1 and tier2 teams.

I watched both and I noticed how much more kills have dota2 pro games comparing to LoL's.

But I can't get why?!

LoL has so many objectives: dragons, nashor which make you fight for them and I thought it should lead to a huge amount of kills. But surprise! - some games...sorry...not some but most of them are just BORING. Both teams play very safe and just throwing skills at each other without killing anybody. 

And on the other hand, we have Dota2 with only Roshan from minute 20(if I'm not mistaken). But dota pro games almost always are very active, teams more aggressive and it's not boring at all.

Lol mechanics are more ""oneshot'y"" because skills damage scales with items and it seems that it should help to kill a champion and lead to more kills overall but it doesn't.

I mean what are the reasons behind such plays in LoL? Is it about buyback in dota2 which is absent in Lol?

Rumble has been a controversial topic in the league community ranging from riot casters such as Phreak who hold the position that rumble is bad, to other independent commentators and analysts such as IWDominate holding the position that rumble is incredibly powerful. Whilst I don’t hold the position that rumble is bad, I don’t hold the position rumble is S tier either. Within this article I will try to understand and elicit IWDominates position along with jungle rumble fanatics as best as possible. I also hope to transpire a discussion about rumbles strength within the game.

Firstly, Dominate's comments on Facecheck (Season 3 Episode 16). He claims rumble is amazing, but players don’t know how to properly play him. Good rumble players he pronounces as Wei, River and I hadn’t heard him say it, but I presume Canyon. In other words, 3/5 of the bigger region junglers. IWDominate maintains, certain players don’t know how to play him because he requires procedural knowledge of how to handle his heat mechanic. Players aren’t maintaining 50 or 60 heat so they can overheat at the most salient times within the game. Additionally, he also suggested Rumble’s ultimate can be difficult to efficiently use. These are fair points, but does it line up with the in-game evidence as to why Rumble fails in the hands of Elyoye and Blaber? Initially I will only be looking at rumble games between NA, CN, KR, LMS and LEC. However, if there is no or little evidence then I will look at Rumble picks of NA and EU against minor regions. Let’s see where we can provide evidence for Dom’s point. One note is that I could not assess the jungler’s efficiency of utilizing their overheat mechanic within the jungle to clear monsters. Therefore if anybody has access to such capabilities and would like to provide that evidence please reply and I will link it in the article.

Firstly, C9 vs MAD with Blaber on Rumble. The fight at 3:50 with a  burger flip over Scuttle Crab. Blaber fails to maintain 50 heat therefore Armut escapes alive. If Blaber had overheated properly, the fight would have most likely ended up in a 2 for 2 with elyoye getting the scuttle crab. Certainly, a much different outcome although one that still favours Mad Lions. This is the first instance to Dom’s point. The rest of the game doesn’t show blabber erroneously using his heat mechanic or having any bad ultimate’s that are noteworthy.

Next MAD vs DK day 4. Canyon outspeeds Elyoye in the jungle to get him to a camp lead early on. Could Elyoye have jungled any faster? I don’t know, although clear speeds I list later would corroborate that Elyoye is likely not at fault. There is a fight for scuttle at 6:30, where if armut had flashed earlier or waited for a tick of humanoids ulti MAD would have got out ahead. Additionally, it can be argued rumble placed a reasonably poor equalizer at 14;30 on khan that could have been directed at DK’s bot lane, however it can be argued against, as a counter to predicting a flash over the wall which was the best route for Khan’s safety. At 21:40 Elyoye drops an equalizer that splits Damwon Gaming, however he should have kept the ulti for a better time, so this can be used in favour of Dom’s point, however this isn’t substantially erroneous I argue.

MAD VS PSG DAY 3 and 2. Day 3 First, PSG abuse Rumbles weak level 1 and get off to a head start, the game essentially ends here. There were no heat issues with Elyoye, however there are some instances where ult usage could have been better implemented, but not until MAD are already 10K gold down. MAD VS PSG DAY 2. There were no erroneous overheating mistakes in skirmishes or equalizers from Elyoye.

These were all the ‘major’ region games where Rumble was picked by Blaber and Elyoye. So far the only evidence sufficiently in favour of Dom’s point is the C9 vs MAD game where blabber messes up at the early scuttle fight. Given Elyoyes rare mistakes, I will only now look at Blabers picks on rumble against ‘minor’ regions. There is only one other game which is Infinity esports vs Cloud 9.

INF esports vs Cloud 9. In the early gank from Blaber at 2 minutes. Blaber doesn’t have the ideal heat, however he is only level 2 and if he uses his abilities too early, he will not have them up for the gank. Blaber then ints at 6 minutes trying to towerdive INF’s bot lane, his heat mechanics were fine. But he grievously doesn’t recognize his Q would give him tower aggro. Blaber drops an awful ultimate at 17;30. That’s the end of the Rumbles who aren’t from ‘minor’ regions.

Does Dom’s claim that Rumble is too difficult for people who aren’t Wei, River and Canyon stand up? It’s clear that for Elyoye, Dom is wrong. However, it can be argued Blaber made too many fatal mistakes, in the C9 VS MAD game and in the INF esports game he had a bad ulti. There are three big mistakes from Blaber. Of course, this short review doesn’t detail how the team plays around rumble or how rumble effectively used mechanics within the jungle to improve clear speed, which are some issues with this review. Ultimately, this isn’t much evidence in favour of Dom’s point.

Is the heat mechanic really that difficult? Apart from one instance, which could be argued as a fluke, where Blaber fatally made an error with it, this mechanic should not be difficult at all to sustain. How about equalizers? I demonstrated that apart from two instances the INF vs C9 game and the MAD vs DK day 4 game, bad equalizers are hardly anything to bark about specifically from the junglers he lists as not worthy of rumble. I also had not assessed the other rumble players games from Wei, River and Canyon. Are they making zero mistakes? I remain doubtful of that in their equalizers. There are far more difficult champions with far more difficult mechanics that Blaber and Elyoye have shown they can play in the past.

Next let’s move onto Dom’s points on Rumble from his reply to Phreak. There are 7 aspects that IWDominate lists as to why Rumble is insanely strong, I will list all of them first and interact with them.

1. Fast clear 2. Good scaling up until late 3. One of the best skirmishers 4. Top tier long range engage follow up 5. Combos well with engage supports / tops 6. Manaless 7. 45-55 sec CD at level 11 ultimate.

Firstly, Dom suggests Rumble has sufficiently fast clear speed. Let’s see if Rumbles clear speed really has substance (based on leashless clears). Rumble has an ideal full clear speed of 3:16, Udyr has an ideal full clear speed of 3:00, Morgana has an ideal full clear speed of 2:55. How far behind are other potential meta picks? Kindred has an ideal full clear speed of 3:12, Volibear has an ideal full clear speed of 3:14, Olaf has an ideal full clear speed of 3:07, Fiddlesticks has an ideal full clear speed of 3:05, Lillia has an ideal full clear speed of 3:06. We could also include other champions that could be argued as good such as Karthus, Evelynn, Graves, Lee Sin and Nidalee. These champions all have faster first clear speeds than Rumble. At least for first clear, rumble isn’t coming out ahead. Rumble’s clear speed does ramp up later in the game but as does many of the champions already listed. Given rumbles early clear speed we have identified a minor weakness in rumbles early game, more problems of his early game in conjunction with his first clear I will detail later.

Dom’s next point is that Rumble has good scaling up until late. In other words, Rumble has good scaling up until midgame ends. That’s not much scaling, rumble falls off very hard late game, where his short range and his squishiness (barring ultimate) is abused. Given that, I will also include Dom’s 7th point in this section. Rumble scales great up to here, as at level 11 he bears an ultimate cooldown of 45-55 seconds. This is a very low cooldown for a strong ultimate however, how useful is this low cooldown really? Rumble can freely use his ultimate before objectives spawn, for side lane ganking and poking the enemy prior to objectives whilst also have it up then during the fight at the objective. These are all valid points, however some of this is buffered by the fact that the game is orientated around objectives currently, so side lane ganking isn’t as beneficial. Other issues I will go into later with his ultimate.

Thirdly, Dom claims that rumble is one of the best skirmishers. This is Dom’s strongest point; rumble is highly effective at early game and mid game skirmishing. The current meta, incentivizes early and mid game skirmishing around objectives. I agree with Dom here although this is buffered by some issues: Relatively, Rumble is weak from behind and even game states (unless the draft is suitable- more details to come), his ultimate often requires sufficient setup- especially the later the game goes on, he needs strong lanes relative to other junglers. Merc treads becomes a good buy for the enemy mid and jungle especially since most meta mids deal AP damage and the amount of mobility in the game can make him awkward to use. I will substantiate my basis for these claims later. Let’s continue with Dom’s propositions.

‘Rumble has top tier long engage follow-up’ and ‘Combos well with engage supports’. For Nautilus, Leona and to some degree Alistar, rumble’s ultimate is a great follow-up for these champions. Additionally, in the mid lane there are champions that benefit from Rumble’s ability to split team fights such as Viktor, Orianna and Sylas. However, barring zoe and perhaps nocturne, none of the mid lane meta champs can setup engage for rumble. In the top lane there are not many engage champions either, gnar is of course highly meta. Outside of that Lee sin and Sion can be used for engaging, Lee Sins engage is far more stochastic, however. Sion is also susceptible to being counter picked and doesn’t benefit comparatively to other champs in skirmishing. As for ADC’s, varus and Kalista (who isn’t really meta) do provide some engage. Outside of Gnar there isn’t much hard engage for rumble, other than champions coming out of the support role. Having said this, rumbles ultimate doesn’t necessarily need to be used for engaging, it’s actually a very flexible ability, it can be used in concordance with other champions poke abilities, and it can also be used to disengage fights. This point should have been added in his phreak video, although I may have missed it.

‘Rumble is manaless’, well this is hardly a substrate for making a champion good in league anymore. I would have to see how being manaless relative to other champions gives much of an advantage if any. Pros should know how to properly use and conserve their mana. Also, manaless champions are now often balanced around being manaless within their kit so they don’t incur any or much advantage.

The next portion of this article will assess how good rumble really is using predominantly my own arguments and interacting with Dom’s where necessary. Additionally, based on previous and future comments,  Rumble is demarcated from the same tier as Morgana and Udyr. Although Udyr runs into some of the same issues as rumble, he is far more forgiving thanks to his tankiness, engage ability and insanely strong early game and first clear.

My first claim is that Rumble is relatively weak as a first pick or blind pick in draft. Firstly, rumble can’t be flexed unless your name is Doinb, nor he is even strong into the current mid or top meta champs. Therefore, you essentially reveal to the enemy you are definitely jungling rumble. This brings me to my next point, as enemy knows its jungle rumble you are now detrimented in your mid lane picks. It is incredibly difficult to find an AD mid in the current meta outside of Lucian (who is usually banned) and Tristana (her efficacy in mid, remains dubious) especially one that is blind pickable. So, by picking rumble you are almost guaranteeing a merc treads buy from the opposing mid laner which for the rumble team, hurts you and your mid laner. This is exponentiated by the fact that Rumble vehemently needs to get ahead early and maintain a gold lead through winning skirmishes. For example, in the C9 win over RNG, Perkz literally buys merc treads first item, along with Blaber against the enemy TF and rumble (rumble was second picked blind). Furthermore, rumble needs setup for ganks and skirmishes, merc treads reduces the ability to find picks because of the reduced CC effect.

Parenthetically, when Rumble is behind or even, he’s essentially a walking piece of jell-o that deals a bunch of damage. Due to his lack of utility and survivability he is far more vulnerable to invades relative to other meta picks: Morgana, Udyr, Volibear. Rumble has no comeback mechanics outside of miracle wombo combos. He is so useless from behind. One can claim that my argument is predicated on rumble being behind, thus simply don’t get behind. However, this can be argued for any champion. Rumble requires that you draft to set him up in the early game, have strong lanes and pick CC for his ganks and teamfights. You already reveal your game plan when picking rumble, pick to win early or have a piece of flubber in the jungle. There are more game states that favour Udyr, Morg or even Volibear than Rumble. Of course, this is also relative to the draft, but I claim there are far more drafts that many junglers can fit into than Rumble. In terms of win conditions in a draft, you can make a comp around rumble’s success, but as a first pick or blind pick, it isn’t an effective way.

Arguing further, what’s worse is Rumbles lack of mobility, squishiness, vulnerability to long range and CC. Of course, every champ is vulnerable to CC, but relative to other meta junglers rumble is more vulnerable to CC, because of aforementioned mobility, squishiness and low range. As for long range vulnerability, rumble does have a low cooldown long range ultimate, however given the amount of mobility in the game and the prerequisite that your team set him up for ‘R’ success isn’t something that favours him. Even immobile marksmen can build galeforce now. Of course, his ultimate is great for choke points, however unless you are ahead you won’t be fighting the opposing team in choke points. Most fights that take place in even game states are in the river at dragons and barons. For example (an example not the basis for my argument), in the C9 win over DK early on in the tournament, Canyon on Rumble had very little setup for his ultimate and he looked far weaker. Requiring setup for your most powerful ability demands even more in the draft.

This is a point Dom had already made but the solution isn't as simple as ‘just ward level 1 bro’. Rumble is very weak at level 1 and during his first clear (his first clear is quite slow). The best teams will and always have abused champions with weak level 1s, especially if the enemy team is blind picking a weak level 1 jungler. This opens up rumble to some serious issues other junglers don’t have. On the basis that you can just ward against it, you are using up extra trinket wards for your own team in the early game. This opens your laners up to more ganks (cheese ganks predominantly). Additionally, if your laners have to play safer because you invested more wards in defending rumble early, it’s less likely they can get priority for the early game scuttle crabs and opens up rumble to early invades. In addition, it needn’t even be a level 1 invade, splitting the map early in the game by invading the opposite buff rumble is taking. Then fighting rumble in your own jungle if he tries to take your side of the jungle is also effective, to get ahead of him- a champion that desperately needs to be ahead early. What also exacerbates this is Rumbles relatively slow first clear. Rumble is very weak early on, it’s not trivial, or as simple as just ward bro and you don’t lose anything meaningful.

However, rumble is not a good pick against morgana and especially Udyr. Morgana outperforms Rumble in pick and ban, with her utility in game and her clear speed. Udyr can abuse rumbles weak early game and level 1 in competitive. Udyr and Morgana are in a tier of their own, but teams seem to be quite happy having rumble in the jungle vs Udyr and Morgana often. There are other junglers who can keep up with Udyr and Morgana who matchup better vs them, provide more in draft, can’t be abused so hard in the early game and are more utile from behind without demanding so much in draft and in game. Better picks against Udyr: Kindred, Graves, Taliyah, Lillia, Volibear. Against Morgana: Kindred, Fiddlesticks, Taliyah, Karthus, Nocturne, Olaf, Ivern. Of course, some of these picks depend on the context of the draft however generally, for the sake of making a point they are better than the rumble matchup. I can argue for each champion as to why, but I would never reach the end! I don’t mind doing some though if people feel it is necessary.

As I draw near the conclusion here, I will bring up one of the more controversial topics, in relation to  statistics. Whilst statistics in league of legends, a game with an unbelievably large number of varying variables, results and statistics are not useless. Results and statistics generally shouldn’t be used as the core for an argument, there are some exceptions, for example jungle proximity is a pretty useful statistic or amount of failed engages a player has (think back to when Gorilla played in Europe and the statistics of how many engages, he failed in Korea, how that also continued in EU). Results unlike statistics are usually based more so on the outcome of a certain set of events, if you make what seems like a strong argument and repetitively, in multiple instances, the opposite result happens, you shouldn’t discount the results. To entirely discount the results would be the equivalent of saying science, especially certain fields like the humanities (if you want to call it science, that’s another argument) are entirely useless. Which is quite absurd. Rumbles statistics are a little wonky, the sample size is too small however and doesn’t tell anywhere near the full story.

Although, with that in mind I would like to make one final point in relation to the idea that certain players just don't know how to play Rumble. Rumble has the greatest success on the most dominant teams, RNG and DK. Now, what Dom and others believe is that it is because the junglers on those teams are mainly better at playing rumble which gives rumble his higher win rate there. However, we also have to account for the way in which rumble is effective, he needs a strong early game, wining lanes and to be ahead. Naturally when you pick rumble on the best teams you are going to be more likely to get ahead and maintain your lead simply by having better laners. Is rumble stronger on the strongest teams more because Rumble is a win more champion or because those top team junglers are better at rumble? I claim the former, rumble looks better on the top teams more because his team is better, rather than attributing it mainly to certain junglers being better at him. Rumble is a snowball and win more champion, he must get ahead early and win skirmishes or he has no use.

All that being said, by no means am I suggesting rumble is a weak champion. Many of the critiques I have towards rumble are also sufficient to be directed at other champions in the game. However ultimately, there are a number of critiques I’ve listed here that are distinct to rumble. Without a doubt rumble is a strong champion. Rumble is not incredibly strong or overpowered though, like many champions, given the right draft he can look overpowered, but on a general basis I don’t find that he is. At minimum, please stop blind picking Rumble.

&#x200B;

edit: tl;dr

· Rumble is not first pickable / blind pickable early in the draft. Draft demands a lot for him.

· His most useful and powerful tool requires a comp that gives setup.

· His early game is extremely weak in comparison to other junglers (therefore he has to be drafted around with winning early game champions or strong level 1s, the best teams will and always have abused champions with weak level 1s)

· He doesn’t have much utility or comeback mechanics over other junglers when behind (udyr, morgana, lillia, kindred etc provide utility through cc, utility or tankiness even from behind)

· Rumble is strong but hes not in in S tier cause of mentioned vulnerabilities.

· He makes mid picks more awkward because he deals AP damage. Merc Treads buys super effective. Not many AD mids, lucian normally banned.

· (Not directed towards Dom) The myth that results should never be used in analysis. Whilst they shouldn’t be made as a core argument for what is true, they aren’t irrelevant. The stats do not favour Rumble.

· His ultimate is useless vs champions with mobility. His ultimate is most useful in choke points, from even or behind points in the game for the rumble team, enemy team should not be checking through choke points. They walk through mid-lane into river to objectives where there are no choke points unless behind.

· Rumble is weak against both Morgana and Udyr. Kindred, Volibear, graves and more I list are better picks vs Udyr.",2021-05-18 09:02:30,0.0,nex33d

crl43,Hip_Hop_Pirate,"At least during the laning phase. I haven't seen too many people talking about this, but prior to, and especially now with the Riftmaker buff, Morde's laning phase win rate was the highest of any champion according to most aggregate sites (like [euw.op.gg](https://euw.op.gg)).

He currently only has 9 top laners that have a higher lane kill rate than him, half of which are off-meta, so if you're a top lane player, chances are you'll probably lose lane going in to Morde unless you're playing:  
 Tryndamere, Warwick, Rengar, Volibear, Riven, Akali, Gwen, Zac or Nocturne. Every single other top-laner right now will pretty much lose lane to him, and while Morde doesn't scale amazingly, his ult will always see some good utility in a team fight.  
Now as I've said, this is only really in the laning phase, a lot of top laners can outscale Morde, but Morde will be a massive anti-carry in that sense, plus could be very tilting to go against. I personally hate going into him, it always feels like I have to work extra hard while the Morde player barely put's in any effort to win the exchanges.

3yu0g,Tself,"Ever since I started playing Zac back in season 4 I've wanted this skin concept. His overall shape wouldn't even have to be changed much (or at all). The really exciting thing would happen every time he uses his W and Ultimate: he changes color. 

Imagine starting the game as the usual green Zac, but as soon as you start your jungle clear you start cycling through the rainbow. Blue, purple, red, orange... how exciting and cool would that be? Not to mention when we start throwing his ultimate into the scenario. Every bounce could correspond to a new color change. 

The main concern here could be readability, but I think there are ways to implement this without losing game clarity. For one, keeping close to Zac's original silhouette is paramount, if not making it exactly the same. For two, there is no need for flashy ability animations when its the color change that really needs to shine with this skin. For three, the shades of the colors themselves can be muted or cohesive enough to still be readable as the same champion. While the traditional vibrant rainbow colors may still work just fine, there is room to explore other options if that ended up being too much. For four, this would not be the first time a champion is able to change colors/appearance mid-fight. 

Thoughts? Obviously I'm not expecting to see this anytime soon, and it doesn't have to be connected with pride month; I just always thought it was a rad skin concept that would do well.",2021-05-18 06:04:48,0.0,netb61

[Link (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/nfxgsg/why_does_damwon_kia_have_worse_schedule_in_semis/)

This is an unprecedented decision, as every single MSI had the 1st place team play first, then have a day of rest between semis and finals.

Ashley Kang, reporter for Korizon, reached out to Riot but only received a non-committal answer. She also reached out to DK, who replied that they only chose ""our opponents, MAD Lions"".

&#x200B;

During an interview with OSEN, Kkoma, head coach of DK briefly touched upon the schedule change. (This is significant because Kkoma rarely, if almost never discusses controversial topics - he's actually quite famous for being as inoffensive as possible during interviews.)

&#x200B;

Translation: Semis will be against MAD Lions. We have too little preparation time because finals will be the day after semis. We're forced into a situation where we have to prepare for MAD *and* finals simultaneously. Going to finals without any rest is a first. Obviously, we have to win to go to finals, but we also have to prepare for both. 

&#x200B;

Finally, CloudTemplar, former LCK player and current LCK caster, also spoke out regarding DK's change of schedule. 

[Youtube Link (1:46:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJOVnrJ8wk)

""Imagine if you play semis before finals. You win, but it's late in the day and you're tired already. But you still have to prepare for RNG. DK are 100% gonna be preparing for MAD only, saying that 'they can prepare for RNG at the same time' doesn't make sense. Obviously I'm not claiming that RNG and DK are going to move up, but even if PSG wins, they can prepare for DK while watching them play. That's why playing first has an advantage.""

He also touched on the MSI groups schedule,  where RNG never had a game after 1 am (CST), and concluded with ""companies should love all regions equally, and even if they prefer one region, shouldn't show it.""

Cloudtemplar is up there with Kkoma for being non-committal about topics, and frequently claiming that he is ""Riot Korea's dog"". That he would take a stance regarding this topic is telling.",2021-05-20 12:13:00,632.0,ngqek1

I went through every game so far in the tournament and made a tier list of each role, showing the current win rates, as well as the total number of champions picked.

|Tier|Win Rate|Total # of Picks|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Z|43%|60|
|S|54%|74|
|A|47%|80|
|B|50%|150|
|C|50%|188|
|DONT|51%|110|
|Not in tier list|86%|7|

Important of note, these numbers do not show any context behind them. They are simply a stat of the win rates and that is it. For example, if only RNG or DK picked more champs from a certain tier, that tier would appear skewed higher simply because of the teams picking them, and not because of how good the champs in that tier are. These numbers also do not show any error or standard deviations. When you take error into account, none of the win rates show enough evidence to conclude that they are better or worse than expected.

Personally it felt really good to not wonder ""what if x team got y group instead of the z group"" (or ""what if x team got y team in the quarters instead of z team"" since rumble stage kinda replaced quarters) or be upset that a seemingly strong team didn't get to prove themselves against others due to underperformance earlier in the groups. 

I'm not a huge fan of the small groups into single elimination format we currently have where if a team doesn't make it out of the groups they will have played against a grand sum of 3 opponents. Maybe League could take a page out of dota's book and instead of 4 small groups have 2 large groups into double elim in worlds, with a more spread out schedule, or some other rendition of that where teams get to play more than 3 opponents.",2021-05-20 01:15:34,337.0,ngbhmm

Since 2016 MSI, Semifinal 1 was held on Friday, Semifinal 2 on Saturday, and final was on Sunday (very next day of Semi 2). However, this year, for some reason, Riot decided to give better schedule to second seed.

**2016 Group Stage 1st seed was RNG**

Semi 1:  **RNG** vs SKT on Friday 5/13

Semi 2:  FW vs CLG on Saturday 5/14

Final: SKT vs CLG on Sunday 5/15

**2017 Group Stage 1st seed was  SKT**

Semi 1:  **SKT** vs FW on Friday 5/19

Semi 2:  WE vs G2 on Saturday 5/20

Final: SKT vs G2 on Sunday 5/21

&#x200B;

**2018 Group Stage 1st seed was RNG**

Semi 2:  SKT vs G2 on Saturday 5/18

Final:  TL vs G2 on Sunday 5/19

**2021 Group Stage 1st seed is DWG KIA**

Semi 1:  RNG vs PSG on Friday 5/21

Semi 2:  **DWG KIA** vs  MAD on Saturday 5/22

Final is on Sunday 5/23

&#x200B;

This is from the [rulebook](https://lolesports.com/article/2021-mid-season-invitational-official-rules/blt63505174e66fa3cf) that states how this year's MSI knockout stage is set up.

https://preview.redd.it/nm0c3mu8k0071.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11534d75ed91e30e6bab2b514bab70eda780b63

Possibilities that came up on replies from [Ashley Kang's post](https://twitter.com/AshleyKang/status/1394765552371978240?s=20) about this matter :

1. Riot wanted more viewership in EU since MSI was held in Europe.

\- However, during 2018 MSI which was held in Europe, when RNG chose FNC, they still played on Friday.

2.  Riot wanted more viewership for the Semis.

\- China has the largest viewership compared to any other regions. It would be better for the Chinese viewers for their games to be played on the weekend.

Regardless of the reasons, unless DWG KIA thought having one more day of rest til the Semifinal was more important than having back-to-back Semis and Finals, I think it is unreasonable to give a better schedule to the second seed. If DWG KIA wins the semifinal vs MAD, they have less than 24 hours to have feedback on their Semifinal, prepare for the final, and get some rest.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: According to a [Korean reporter from Kookmin-ilbo](https://twitter.com/midnoflash/status/1394890138711298051), DWG KIA did not choose to play on Saturday, and in fact it is Riot's decision. Riot Korea has also inquired about this matter to Riot.

Going by this site. https://leagueofitems.com/runes/tierlist, Omnistone is exceptional in that it sits at both the lowest W/R and lowest pick rate Keystone in the game, by a large margin. For perspective, according to this site the next lowest picked keystone has 10x more games recorded on this stat site, and the next lowest W/R is a full percent 1% higher, with 100x more games.

This makes me sad. Omnistone is a super fun keystone. Going by the stats,  it is not helping you win games. 

It does have potential to be powerful and have a possible well defined niche of ""aggressive sustained combat keystone"" if used well. Especially if  it is finally given the buffs it deserves, before being replaced it outright.

Besides having bad stats, I believe that Omnistone suffers from people not understanding what power it does offer. This keystone rewards aggressive play in lane if you can make use of it, since you have a keystone up more than all others except for Conqueror and Grasp. This keystone could become a true third option for ""aggressive sustained combat"". I get hints of the *good* gameplay parts of old Kleptomancy from it whenever I can chain 3 or 4 Omnistone procs in a row, since I'm getting rewarded for being aggressive.

It does feel super bad when you hit a dud keystone, or you end up saying "" why didn't I just pick Grasp/Conqueror "".

Some ideas I like for how it could be further changed to make the niche more obvious for Omnistone:

- Position it as a true sustained combat keystone by offering a small heal (+ MAYBE small mana gen?) on each proc.

- Enforce the keystone rotation to go from tree to tree, something like Domination -> Precision -> Resolve -> Sorcery -> Inspiration -> Domination. This would reduce the large variance in the keystone by a reasonable amount.

- Extend the 'dark harvest amp' that only DH procs gives to your keystones to ALL procs, i.e. rewards you for using the keystone a LOT.

- Add a condition to let Aftershock proc on two auto attacks so it can be in the rotation. Guardian COULD be added to give a self shield.",2021-05-20 02:41:46,87.0,ngdkjq

s3ajqy4,giantZorg,"Hello all

I'm currently doing some visualization of mythic and legendary item diversity. There will be a long post at some point with explanations and region comparisons, but I wanted to share some graphs on mythic item diversity anyway as I think they are already interesting on their own.

I do this because I some people at work misconfigured some stuff, so until this is solved I'm learning new things using league data. I have no affiliation with Riot.

I'm in the process of downloading a lot of data, the graphs below use the information of around 80000 games played in EUW in patch 11.9. The graphs are all 4000x1600 pixels, so maybe you have to open them in a new tab to see the details properly.

Here is a heatmap for the mythic item diversity (green = frequently chosen, red = not chosen at all), sadly not very mobile friendly:

[Heatmap of mythic item frequencies \(ranked, EUW, patch 11.9\). Green fields are frequently chosen, red fields never. The uppermost row represents no mythic item bought.](https://preview.redd.it/ozdcskqzw2071.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=64e83553462f17daeaac55c5afd74fff4bb107c5)

In the long post, I will make some tables, but already viewing the heatmap we can see (not surprisingly) rather little variation for many champions. We can also see just how few champions pick some of the lesser used mythics like e.g. Shruelia's, Imperial mandate or Iceborn.

The following heatmap shows the differences between ranked games as normal games:

[Heatmap of mythic item frequency differences for normals compared to ranked \(EUW, patch 11.9\). Green fields mean more popular in normals, yellow no difference and red less popular in normals compared to ranked.](https://preview.redd.it/7pnx0im103071.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=27679b9f74e2f83b46b9eab0235d45ba62d17d1e)

We see that a lot more games where no mythic item was finished (top row), as well as people not building (or being able to finish) items like Shurelia's, Locket and Lyandries.

As a frequent ARAM player, I was also interested in the difference between the mythic items bought in ranked games and in ARAM games. These are shown in the following heatmap:

[Heatmap of mythic item frequency differences for ARAM compared to ranked \(EUW, patch 11.9\). Green fields mean more popular in ARAM, yellow no difference and red less popular in ARAM compared to ranked. Some mythic items like e.g. Sunfire, Ludens and Duskblade are way more popular compared to ranked games.](https://preview.redd.it/hpsv7q5lx2071.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c273761a81bbf3cf33f5cf0a7182382a0148995)

It is interesting (but not too much surprising) that some items are way more bought in ARAM compared to ranked games. Sunfire gets bought by the support tanks instead of locket, while the damage/burst items Night harvester, Lyandries, Ludens and Duskblade are bought on a lot of champions that would opt into other items like Rocketbelt, Everfrost and Eclipse.

I also made a heatmap showing which champions are played more or less in which queues (colors are scaled from green (champion more frequent compared to in other queues) to red (champion less frequent compared to in other queues) within each queue):

[Heatmap showing which champions are preferably played in which queue \(EUW, patch 11.9\). Colors are scaled for each queue with green denoting a champion very frequent in the respective queue, and red less frequent in the respective queue.](https://preview.redd.it/cwlz74d813071.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead38593602935a2a3a5f9c9e38fb4f91ac49477)

There are clear groups of champions which are played more or less in certain queues. Keep in mind that this could either be because some champions are preferredly played in queues like ARAM, or that players avoid playing certain champions in queues like ranked.

And lastly, to show just how unpopular flex queue is (compared to the other queue types), here is the heatmap of the champion pick frequencies but not scaled to the individual queues (in this graph, all frequencies for a champion add up to 1):

[Heatmap showing the champion pick frequencies \(EUW, patch 11.9\). Flex queue is always red \(not frequent\) as there are in general way fewer flex games compared to ARAM and ranked.](https://preview.redd.it/rt8p2o0p23071.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c17c2a38eb63700f6be7975cc9f2861438a52c0)

I hope you liked some of the graphs and find them as interesting as I do. As said in the beginning, I'm in the process of downloading the same data for NA and KR, but it will take probably 1 week to get enough data (I'd need a Riot API production key to get it done faster) as well as looking into the legendary item (combinations) bought, but this will be for another (quite long) post.

syni5,Eentity,"Currently the item does 1.2% of enemy HP per second, considering it was supposed to be the equivalent of liandrys torment in a way from older seasons, it can't compare to a 10% damage amp and 2.5% max hp per sec. And I get why, because it can be used with Liandry's Anguish which would make it nuts. But still, the item for the intended users is just laughably weak. I see Mordekaiser as one of the best champions in playstyle to fit with the item (sure there are other like Singed, Zac, Sej, etc...) the item is so weak I, and a lot of players, don't build it on him in favour of other items. 

Why is that? Could Riot buff the item? No, because things like artillery mages and champions that apply a DoT that keeps refreshing the proc on the item exist (Yes hello AP kog, lillia, brand and the sort) and they just abuse this item to the limit. And the item is at a point it can't be buffed without directly buffing these champions.

So a change for the item would be to make it scale off your OWN HP instead of enemies. This way the item can't be abused by artillery mages and DoTguys since they don't tend to build any HP in their kit, a Rilays at maximum. While the bruisers and even tanks that want some damage could spec into this item to add damage to their abilities and the burn.

Also it would be nice if the build path wasn't the same as Rilay AND gave the same stats Why not make this build out of Bami Cinder for example, or the ""Run Fast Pants"" that I forgot the name which builds into FoN and Deadman's plate? Or instead of HP it just gave more armor and MR as a base value and more on the proc?

But the real clutch purchase was the 100,000 BE Gemstone King Icon that comes with a gemstone. Eager to crank open that chest, I opened it and got the one thing I've ever truly wanted. 

&#x200B;

The ""My Cocoa"" Monkey Emote which is no longer available for purchase. The all purpose emote that is applicable in any situation.

&#x200B;

First blood? monkey emote. Fail flash? Monkey emote. Flash in to finish off the enemy carry only to be denied because the enemy senna made them go invisible? Monkey Emote

ffg50,rubixor,"Seriously, he seems like a great fit for the jungle to me because

1) he would be able to more efficiently utilize his passive

2) super creative gank paths with magical journey

3) great 2v2 and 3v3 skirmishing for interactive river fights over scuttle

4) toplaners and midlaners are already used to seeing bard show up in their lanes all the time

5) botlaners are already used to being completely ignored by bard

He checks all the boxes that make for good junglers, except that he can't clear well at all. I really think it would just take some tweaks to the way his meep empowered autos work on jg camps and his clear would be good enough to make him a jungler.

NA salaries have risen to such an extend that the org's themselves want import restrictions removes so that they can lower the salaries that they have overinflated in the first place. So I don't think it is healthy for a league to pay as much as NA does with the amount of money currently coming in. 

But regardless, there is massive difference in the average salary you make here in Europe compare to the salary in NA. So my question is simple, how can teams insure they make more money to compete with NA in this regard, and what is the difference that makes NA investors so willing to invest in NA, but are the investors in EU more reserved with their spending (since EU has many more average and peak viewers then NA and better performance as well)?",2021-05-20 18:37:26,2.0,ngwr67

8iauwj69,myydaddybeatme,"There is something I always wanted and thought about it so I think it is time to share my thoughts.

I was thinking about new key stone concepts made for bruisers or tanks if they wanted more durability in extended fights .

I call it wrath of the giants

Each time you hit an enemy champion with an ability or basic attack you gain 1 stack for ranged 2 stack for melee.

Each stack gives you armor and magic the value is increased by your level 
max at 12 stack.

Upon reaching max stack u gain 10% damage reduction.

Why I think this is a good idea ?

Because every bruisers only take conquerer since it is the only viable keystone for them 

While the other champions have more then one keystone to choose all as viable as the others .

It is very good and decent concept for diversity and could help champions for have some different play style if they want to be frontline by taking this keystone or be a better duelling by taking conquerer.

Please guys tell what do you think about it.",2021-05-20 08:28:31,12.0,nglsz1
6ugok,Illsonmedia,"Sometimes I struggle to know what to do here.  For example, my bot lane might be like 3-0, should I help them snowball?  Other times my top lane is really bad. Either they're getting crushed by simply a better player, or for whatever reason when I gank with them, we are not coordinated - we just don't gel.  Should I commit more time to the top lane in this example, that's struggling?  I never really know, and even as I think about it now and type out this question, I cannot forecast one scenario that's better than the other, in general applications.

&#x200B;

\- Mute everyone, leave pings open. Tell them they're muted but ping sums. FOCUS and immerse yourself into the game

&#x200B;

\-  See what build to use based on team comp and which lanes you should focus more on ganking. Picture how team fights will go (Peel, focus, priorities, build, etc). Check where enemy jgler started by checking their laner's time of arrival and any mana/hp drain

&#x200B;

\- Use F–Keys (f1, f2, etc) to help with checking every lane. Be on time for ganks/objectives. Always be aware of the situation, be proactive, and don’t waste time. Ping your laner before every gank to let them know

&#x200B;

\- Too much farming is as bad as too little farming. The perfect balance is the key. Help push for objectives

&#x200B;

\- Don’t over focus specific objectives and don’t force it if you can’t. Can only do what you can do, and giving them extra kills won’t make it better. Set up the game in a way as a team that will allow safe objectives attack. Can try to use enemy’s time of taking objectives/their map positioning to your advantage. Careful not to only atk monster and leave your team in a outnumbered situation

&#x200B;

\-  Just focus on not making mistakes and doing the right thing in any situation, good or bad. We’ve all been there, no need to be overly tilted. Just make the best of it

&#x200B;

\- Quick in and out, and in again when team fighting. React fast and focus on priority targets. Careful not to waste damage/abilities on less important people unless you have to

&#x200B;

\- Avoid fair fights as much as possible, pick people off

&#x200B;

\- Look to help crash wave after gank. Helps teammate recall and spend the gold

&#x200B;

\- Play around waves. Maybe collect waves if laner ignores. Push the waves into the neutral / pressure zone.

&#x200B;

\-    Watch for distance between targets to get picks. Ambush people, especially in late game. Bait, become the king of mind tricks, and make optimal use of every second!",2021-05-20 13:44:46,3.0,ngs3oa

Instead of simply translating Riot's original announcement in English, [found here](https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/celebrating-pride-with-you#:~:text=May%2017%2C%202021&text=We%20launched%20the%20Rainbow%20Fluft,game%20across%20May%20and%20June.), Riot Turkey seems to have opted to replace any mentions of pride and the LGBTQIA+ communities with ""the celebration of the spring colors"" that are ""**all around the northern hemisphere during months of May and June**,"" and to explicitly link the cause for celebration to the calendar season in [their localized announcement in Turkish](https://tr.leagueoflegends.com/tr-tr/news/community/2021-renk-senligi-ni-runeterra-ve-otesinde-kutla/).

It's not clear whether this blatant self-censorship is dictated by the Riot Games HQ or is by Riot Turkey's own decision, but in any case I believe that the end product is a disgusting mockery of the LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The erasure goes against the very idea of pride and, in my own opinion, is infinitely worse than Riot Turkey simply choosing not to celebrate pride.

The most probable reason for this decision is the fear of going against the Turkish government's increasingly draconian stance on LGBTQIA+ acceptance. However, it already has been banned to display any form of LGBTQIA+ symbolism (the most prevalent example being the rainbow flag) in the visual media and Riot Turkey's announcement and actions thus far seem to be the unaffected by that ban, which makes me wonder who exactly Riot and/or Riot Turkey is afraid of antagonizing. Unfortunately, homophobia and transphobia are also widespread among the Turkish player base and it's entirely within the realm of possibility that Riot and/or Riot Turkey wants to avoid alienating their less open-minded players. The last and the most horrifying probable reason for this erasure that I can think of is Riot Turkey's members' own personal views clashing with Riot's support for LGBTQIA+ players and communities, which I truly hope that is not the case here.",2021-05-18 21:17:42,6382.0,nfahuh

**See above**

&#x200B;

# Warmog's Armor

* Health Requirement: 3000 maximum health >>> 1100 bonus health

**You thought Mundo healing back everything was uninteractive? Welcome to patch 11.11 where every tank can do this now at two items!**

&#x200B;

# >>> Champion Nerfs <<<

Morgana

>**W**

* Monster damage bonus: 185% >>> 155%

**We screwed up so hard then we screwed up by not anti-screwing up hard enough. So now we're hoping we didn't anti-screw up too hard this time.** 

Lee Sin

>**E**

* Cooldown: 8 >>> 9s

**This one has got our head scratching. We blasted his base stats into the sky, yet he still isn't viable as a jungler but is instead taking it to lanes? Nerfing a key waveclear ability that he uses both in jungle and in lane so that he becomes unviable in both.**  

Rumble

>**P**

* Monster On-Hit damage cap: 120 >>> 80

**I hope we get this one right on the first try, rather than missing it by 30% like we did for Morgana. Come back next patch to find out!**

Elise

>**Spider form**

* Auto Attack AP ratio: 30% >>> 20%

**Elise has been rappeled in the air for so long that everyone's probably forgotten about her except the diehard mains. That's why we're deciding to hurt the only people who care about Elise. We're just so kind this way.**  

Leona

>**W**

* Damage: 60-200 >>> 50-190

**Our new balancing staff does not take kindly to weebs and waifus so Beryl and Leona are taking a hit.**

Urgot

>**W**

* AD ratio: 20-36% >>> 20-34%

**This will solve all our problems with people complaining about Urgot**

Shaco

>**W**

* Damage per hit AP ratio: 10% >>> 9%

>**E**

* AP ratio: 55% >>> 50%

**Changing Shaco's AP ratio from 10% to 9% to get a slightly uglier number that matches his physical appearance.**

Qiyana

>**W**

* Movement Speed: 5-13% >>> 3-11%

**Y'all thought nerfing Katarina's base MS by 5 was too little, so we're upping the nerfs to roaming assassins to a massive 2% MS nerf to Qiyana only for when she uses W.**

\>>> Champion Buffs <<<Azir

>**Q**

* Mana cost: 70 >>> 55

**This'll give new players about 15 more tries to land that 3-soldier auto in lane. They'll get there one day!**

Graves

>**Base stats**

* AD per level: 3 >>> 4

**Big moustache man needs to get bigger quicker**

Hecarim

>**Q**

* Bonus AD ratio: 70 >>> 75%

>**E**

* Min bAD ratio: 50% >>> 55%
* Max bAD ratio: 100% >>> 110%

**Hecarim mains' heart rate must have been faster than Hecarim's MS with old chemtank with the number of changes to him recently. Hopefully by introducing yet another change all the Hecarim mains will have a heart attack and his winrate will finally drop.**  

Ryze

>**Base stats**

* HP per level: 98 >>> 110

**We felt it wasn't right to ban players for playing Ryze (ahem,** [half-inting](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/nax6t0/ryze_now_has_a_43_winrate_which_is_roughly/)**)**

Ezreal

>**Base stats**

* Health regen per level: 0.55 >>> 0.65
* Armor: 22 >>> 24

**This slippery fucker is going to get even harder to kill.** 

Seraphine

>**W**

* Self shield: 75-150 >>> 75-225
* Ally shield: 50-100 >>> 50-150

**From a design perspective, we really want Seraphine in Mid. We believe the main reason why Seraphine isn't in mid is because ally junglers are too chad to help gank the e-girl. Strengthening her ally shield to tempt thirsty junglers to come more often. (We foresee no effects of this buff on Seraphine support).** 

Illaoi

* Pushed because we're buffing many of her core items

**HAHA YOU THOUGHT**

Teemo

>**W**

* Cooldown: 17 >>> 14s

**This'll bring his W which gives mobility to be on par with fizz E which gives mobility, untargability, damage, and soft cc on one ability.** 

Nautilus

>**E**

**\[NEW\]** Monster Mod: 200% increased damage against monsters

**Since our experimentation with Morgana showed 200% to be too high of a number, we learned our lesson and made sure to use 200% for Nautilus' jungle buffs as well.** 

Singed

>**E**

* Cooldown: 10 >>> 10-8s

**Yes, yes, we know that singed isn't a viable champion anymore due to mobility creep. That's why we'll let singed mains watch champions dash away after being flinged 10% more often so they are more often reminded of Singed's unviability.** 

&#x200B;

# >>> Champion Adjustments <<<

Master Yi

>**Q**

* AD Ratio: 100% >>> 90%

>**E**

* On-Hit Base damage: 20/30/40/50/60 >>> 30/40/50/60/70

**Perhaps allowing Yi to press Q and score pentakills in the late game was uncalled for, so we're toning that down in exchange of allowing him to press Q for doublekills earlier.** 

Senna / Frostfire Gauntlet

>**Frostfire Gauntlet (Item)**

* Ranged Slow: 25% (+4% per 1000 HP) >>> 12.5% (+2% per 1000 HP)
* Ranged Cooldown: 4 >>> 6s
* Changes extended to Rimforged Grasp (Ornn Upgrade)

Senna

>**Base stats**

* Health Per level: 75 >>> 82

>**P**

* Ranged increase Per 20 Mist: 25 >>> 20

>**Q**

* Healing: Now scales with 160% Lethality

>**E**

* Bonus Move Speed: 20% >>> 20% (+0.05% Ability Power)

>**R**

* Physical Damage AP ratio: 50% >>> 70%

**Nobody knows what on earth to build on Senna, and we want to keep it that way by removing a somewhat settled build path for her once again.**

15i04yjy,sapojapoo,"So my friend started playing lol around the time the pandemic started. Since he played with me and some other friends (Silver 2 - Gold 1) he lost lane a lot but improved rapidly. We play clash every time it ist up and he performs decently although he is sometimes matched against platinum or gold players. Sure he‘ll be behind in CS but he plays safe tanks und doesn’t feed. 
So to summarize, playing with us against higher elo he performs allright and doesn’t int or tilt. 

But his soloq is completely different. After the placements where he was placed in silver he quickly dropped to bronze and then iron. That’s no problem maybe it is his real rank. He asked me what he could do to improve since he feels that iron doesn’t represent his rank. So i look at his match history and review a few ges with him. 

And he just tilts out of his mind after dying in a 1v1 top lane. After dying he insta tps back to pane and tries to kill the enemy resulting in another death. And that’s basically every game. So i told him to play safe, don’t take bad early trades and basically just play like in clash with us. 

So he tries to do that. Now yesterday he got a 2 week ban for intentional feeding. I look at his match history and sure enough 0/23/1 Irelia game after a 1/19/1 irelia game. 

So my question is how can we help him change his mindset so he doesn’t get banned again and maybe start to climb. Had some of you similiar cases in your friendgroup?",2021-05-20 18:11:24,0.0,ngwbgc

Also, I need champs who are also strong late game, bc almost every match I play last around 40 - 60 min, so I need a strong late game champ.

All this time I've done no major changes to my playstyle and I've experienced these kinds of drops and climbs atleast the last few years of playing league.

Last season I almost immediately went to dia 4 at the start of the season, to dropping to plat 4 for a few hundred games only to climb back to dia 4 at the end of the season.

Why does this happen and what is an actual way to improve on consistency as to not have crazy fluctuation in rank every other week?

53lqwh7r,Dense-Acanthocephala,"Between streamers, Twitter analysts and this community, I've found that the consensus winning draft this season is almost always the one that scales harder. Ask yourself how often the team that gets outscaled is considered to have won draft.

I often hear things like ""welp, blue team had to win by 20 min or gg"". While this doesn't explicitly say that blue side lost draft, it can be inferred a very good portion of the time. This comment and others make it sound very dire for the blue team and that they have the less desirable position.

Is there a difference between the winning draft and the draft that outscales? I feel like we've reached a point where we might as well just deem the harder scaling draft to be superior.",2021-05-20 05:15:35,9.0,nghcxh
7c9dqd9v,Monarch-Shen,"This fan-based opinion offers an alternate viewpoint to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/nfxgsg/why_does_damwon_kia_have_worse_schedule_in_semis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about how Riot rigged the MSI schedule to favor 2nd seeded RNG.

First of all, I am an LPL fan, but definitely not an RNG fan. And I do like good League, which means I also admire DK in terms of their talent and skill, and obviously as the defending World champions.

But many reasons are given in that post (namely regurgitated quotes from certain famous LCK personalities) are quite disturbing.

It is probably already common knowledge that Riot released an official statement about RNG facing \[illness\] protocol-scheduling conflicts, so I won't elaborate on that. But here's the gist of my argument against anyone claiming there's a pro-RNG bias on the Riot side.

# 1. “China has good viewership, which means that scheduling weekend games for the Chinese audience are beneficial for money.”

I'm not saying this IS or ISN’T the reason why Riot did it. Clearly, they say it's not. But hey, if you were the CEO of a company, would you not do what it takes to make more money (assuming it's legal and not immoral)? We live in a capitalist world. And forget the money - even VIEWERSHIP is important, because Riot wants to get their brand out to the world, and if there are more people in China and more people to view the games, that is a GOOD thing. As League of Legends fans, regardless of your region, you should be happy when a company cares about its image and getting itself out there.

# 2. ""Riot should have planned the logistics better and ahead of time, anticipating that [illness] test protocols could affect scheduling.""

No one can plan with full knowledge of everything that may or may not happen in the future. Several countries, and regions within countries have to tweak protocol regulations based on the situation. It's impossible to ensure that all the proper protocols were pre-planned by Riot and that they could anticipate any last-minute changes. Crap happens in life. Adapt (by Riot changing the schedule) and deal with it (by DK winning despite a less favorable schedule).

# 3. ""Having the potential Finals just one day after the Semifinals are unfavorable, due to the lack of prep time.""

I got nothing against Coach Kk0ma who is in some's opinion GOATed - but if you're really that great, then learn to adapt. Also, the idea that this is definitely in favor of RNG is quite misleading. Momentum is a thing. Feel is a thing. Athletes (of sports, not esports) who take extended breaks between games can actually lose the FEEL for the game. Yes, gaming is a bit different, but the argument that having a 0-day break is unfavorable is NOT one-sided. You can't just come up with all these excuses ahead of time and use them as a backup in case you lose.

# Having said that...

I really don't think there's a clear disadvantage to having no rest. And even if there was a clear one, \[illness\] is a thing and \[illness\] doesn't give a crap about what we care about. Testing protocols are part of life and we gotta deal with them. Riot did the best they could, and LCK fans should just chill and know that IF they are confident that DK is the better team, then NONE OF THIS SHOULD MATTER. (And by the way, I think DK is the best team in MSI, since I thought certain other LPL teams would've been better than RNG as their rep...)

Now, this post might get deleted, downvoted, or whatever. But I'm saying it as I feel it because someone needs to speak up!",2021-05-20 16:47:28,1.0,nguxr4
2sj5ihvy,zickkityy,"Normally my queue times are less than a minute, since I'm a jungle main, but for whatever reason, these past few days I'm getting 10-15 minute queue times. Is there a reason that this is happening?

1879h3pb,jokesonrace,"DK picked RNG as semi finals opponent. Would it then be semi finals#1 or semi finals#2? Are they hoping PSG will take down RNG for them? If not force RNG to reveal enough strats so they can better prepare for the finals.

Does that really give them that much of an advantage? If you want to be best, why does it matter if you face your worst enemy now or your worst enemy later. 

If DK beat RNG in semis, and ended up losing to the winner of PSG/MAD what excuses what there be then? On the flip side if they took it all and won MSI, are the winner of PSG/MAD allowed to complain the lack of rest day for them?

Is DK picking MAD lions because they are trying to prevent PSG or MAD upset over the LPL/LCK and taking the additional seed for worlds. Otherwise what is the reason?

If DK won MSI, LCK get +1 seed worlds and the next best performing region is lpl. If RNG won MSI, the next best performing region whether DK is 2nd place or 3/4th is still LCK and they still get +1 seed worlds. 

Summary of all possible dimensions: lck/lpl win MSI and both lpl and lck get +1 seed for worlds because MSI winner and next best performing region.",2021-05-20 16:00:25,1.0,ngu8fm

btp9fb2,BulletCola,"Idk, I mean the first skins of Piltover Customs were basically just ""Hot Rods, but to Piltover/Zaun champs"", which were only just Blitzcrank, Corki, & Heimerdinger, and that was during a time when Piltover didn't really have much of a similar aesthetic as to what it is today.

So the idea of having the hextech/steampunk aesthetics of Piltover, and mix that with the 1950's/60's semi-rockabilly style aesthetic would be pretty dang cool imo.

Imagine that kind of aesthetic towards other Piltover/Zaun champs like Ezreal, Jinx, Mundo, Viktor, Camille, Ziggs, the new Zaun ADC champ and so on.

What do you think?

ja6sh,Slav_1,"There's so much content to learn in this game in terms of macro strategy (strong side/weak side, rotations, ganking, invading, etc.) but I think the most overwhelming to new players is the idea that to get better they'd have to learn what every champion does. I wonder this sub thinks is the average level of a player who knows about pretty much every ability/champion. Of course in the process of amassing this knowledge you get a fair amount of marco/strategic knowledge on how to play the game but they still don't necessarily coincide. Also, to specify, I mean know about the abilities and be able to think of them while playing (such as trying to recall out of vision if the enemy team has a global ult or a nocturne or knowing the range of the lane opponents poke ability) not just being able to vaguely guess it from memory but still be confused or unsure when playing against it.

3ecbkijf,BadShy,"While in the shower I was thinking about what made earlier seasons in league of legends feel like a bit more fun to me. 
Something that always came to mind was that the classes actually felt like classes.
A tank was a tank, a mage was a mage, an marksman also known as ADC back then was mostly a pure physical fast attacking backliner. Now we have three or so marksmen that deals magic damage on autos or procs not as strong as an mage but they are there.
And we also have divers such as Samira and Kai'sa that dives into the backlines which is an assassins role so to say.
Diversity in classes is awesome to have don't get me wrong, but there should perhaps be an set level of maximum mobility on an marksman, dashes, boost in movement speed as an example could be the maximum level of mobility an marksman can have achieve to make it feel more like an class of its own.

We also have a lot more mage items that gives lots of health. 4 out of 6 "" mage "" mythic items gives health instead of the usual mana that a mage would get, of course there are bruiser mages and mage assassins that don't value the mana as much or not at all. We've lost some bruiser mage items but gotten that health spread out on various items instead which in the end makes the class mage less of an variety as most of the mages now gets more health in some sort of way.
Same goes for the support class, every mythic gives a base value of health and no base mana just some percentage regen. If 4 out of 6 classes gets a lot of health of their items, what is the meaning of having a tank related items when mage items gives same amount of health. 

I'm counting tank, mage, enchantress / support, and fighter / bruiser as the classes that have and easier way to get health on their items while marksmen and assassins barely has any way to do so or none at all. 
With the new mythic passives assassins and marksmen can get shields if they manage to deal damage or get hurt enough but I wouldn't say that it makes them "" tankier "" per say.
With every class having a way of getting healthier in the game it feels like it forces you to go with those said items that gives health while there are a lot of other items that makes your class feel more like an role in the game. 
Don't get me started on all the healing as well, goredrinker etcetera.
With the old rune system and item variety in such way that not all items gave the same sort of stat the game felt like your class meant something. 

But these are just my thoughts and opinions, what are you guys thoughts on season 11 so far, have the new items made the game less of an variety, does your favorite class still feel like its unique? Has the game gone stale and boring or are you still enjoying yourself as you use to, lets talk about it!

Tl:dr

Felt like the games diversity in classes meant something in earlier seasons, to much health on to many items now.",2021-05-20 15:12:56,1.0,ngthqo
5xd43n6g,Casual_gamer42069,"In norms you can play as a team, have fun and communicate with some friends. In ranked it's all just chaos. In norms it feels like a 5v5 if you play with friends, in ranked it feels like 1-1-1-1-1v1-1-1-1-1  

My idea of a good time is not begging my midlaner to not rq because he died five minutes into the game. ""Just /mute all"" then that defeats the purpose of the team in team game. And that won't stop my midlaner from rqing, or my bot lane from intentionally feeding turning the enemy samira into an unstoppable god with a floating cat. 

With the focus riot has put on removing hypercarries and trying to make it more of a team game, ranked feels like absolute dogshit to play. Sure if you can't play with friends playing in norms can be like that, but people in norms are normally more relaxed then in ranked, because there are no stakes, no consequence to losing. Even if your bot goes 0/10 at fifteen minutes in norms it's fine, because nothing matters, its norms and normally people don't hold hostage, at least in my experience.  

The changes riot made to make it more of a team game is great, if you have a group of friends willing to play league with you. Otherwise sometimes there is absolutely nothing you can do even if you went 20/0 because all other enemy roles are also 20/0 and you can't 1v9",2021-05-20 14:57:56,0.0,ngt9a6

Source: https://www.surrenderat20.net/2021/05/517-pbe-update-summoner-icon-tweaks.html

Warmog itself gives you 800 bonus health.

Bami's Cinder, which builds into every tank mythic gives 300 health for 1100 gold.

Both combined give 1100 bonus health in total.

So for the low price of 4100 gold, you'll have one of the most desired effects in the gamemode. Anyone who plays this mode for reasonable amount of time knows just how absurd this will become. Usually most of tanks have to postpone buying Warmog until third item, because they can't get required amount of max health to make it active earlier. Now they will be able to straight up rush it and become damage sponges making huge wins in trades for their teams extremely early on.

Also alternatively you can go Guardian's Horn + Ruby Crystal + Warmog for 4350 gold (also 1100 bonus health), still works, probably even better.

Edit: And if you feel extremely greedy, Warmog+2xRuby Crystal for 3800 gold is also a possibility.",2021-05-19 04:23:10,532.0,nfl6em

7k7l1,Dingding12321,"They just don't have that oomph or pizzaz anymore like they used to.  What they need isn't raw buffs, either - their mechanics are inherently game breaking as-is.  What they do need is slight love taps, to make room for a bonus permanent stat or effect on top of what they already do.  That way their unique aspect can stay tame while they also stay relevant.  The funnest keystones in the game shouldn't strictly be the worst ones!

1.) Nerf Glacial Augment's slow a little and in return give it a bit of base armor, like 5-20 depending on level.  It's flavorful in that it's ice armor, it could help tanky junglers clear with a bit more health and it could even pass as a solo or support keystone.  Free armor's just that valuable right now!  

2.) Nerf Unsealed Spellbook, and give it homeguards on EVERY recall, not just on death!  If players pick a keystone that's not going to do damage or actively proc on anything, then let it get players back to playing the game faster.  It would make it a more solid keystone for everyone, even if it wouldn't be ideal for every champion.  At least the few champions that pick it occasionally will pick it more often!  It would also make it more of a newbie-friendly and fun-to-use  keystone as well.

3.) Nerf Prototype: Omnistone a little, and let it give players a little Adaptive Force based on level!  It could help champions last-hit early on, as well as give their random keystones a tiny bit more oomph.  Junglers and solo laners that aren't picky with keystones would love or at least consider taking this one if it came with a bit of extra damage.

4.) Make Guardian's shield more reliant on HP scaling for it to be effective, and let it give players early game HP!  Everyone would love their supports having this.

4a.) Also consider swapping Glacial Augment with Guardian for their respective trees.  Resolve was never known for giving players roundabout tools; every Resolve keystone should make the user specifically more powerful, not only alongside their teammates.  Also Aftershock is taken by literally every top 5 support right now anyway because Guardian is currently too reliant on teammates and doesn't contribute enough consistently.  If Glacial Augment got innate defensive stats on it, it would absolutely be a worthy Resolve keystone.  Not that it's important, just sayin'.

As a completely out-of-left-field side note, maybe biscuits are bad for the game atm.  Maybe not, but still it's food for thought.

**How to pronounce it**:

* [/ku də ɡɹæs/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet) which is pronounced as ""**COO DE GRASS**"".

**Fun facts**:

* The French word [*gras*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gras#French), which means fat, is pronounced  /ɡɹɑ/ i.e. ""graw"".So when you're pronouncing coup de grâce as ""coo de graw"", you're basically saying ""strike of fat"" in French.
* The French word [*coupe*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coupe#French), which means ""cup"", ""goblet"", is pronounced  /kup/ i.e. ""coop"". So ""coop de graw"" can be understood in French as ""cup of fat"".
* Most final consonants are silent in French. E.g. we pronounce *gras* and *coup* respectively by ""graw"" and ""coo"" as already seen.
* Final ""e"" is silent in French. Yet, the final ""e"" enforces the pronunciation of the preceding consonant. That's why we pronounce *cou****p****e* as ""coop"" and *grâ****c****e* as ""grass"".
* *Coup de grâce* literally means ""strike of mercy"" in French.
* This mispronunciation is a case of [hyperforeignism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism).

6ruq7,CSDragon,"I've been watching a lot of non-lol streams in the last while, and between stuff like Among Us, Hololive, OfflineTV, Critical Roll, etc, I find myself drawn to streaming groups, not individual streamers. And back in the day League to have this.

Back in seasons 0-2, you could hop on a TSM, CLG or DIG stream and watch the team itself stream. Season 5 CLG as well was well known for their full team streams. And on the content creation side, you had channels like ThePeacePigeon and Trinimortal where you would get to see a group of friends genuinely having fun playing the game together. 

There also used to be a lot more community between individual content creators. For instance, famously Gbay99 and Athene did a collab where they got drunk and gbay puked on stream. And there was the great LoL Cypher where a single video got passed between prominent content creators 

I realized that that was one of the things I'd been missing about League from ""back in the day"". Why I'd turned from watching lol streams to among us streams and then to vtuber streams.

Even though League is a team game, nobody plays anything but solo queue. There's no personalities bouncing off each other, and interpersonal fun to be had. Just one guy who's mad at the 9 people he's playing with.",2021-05-19 16:58:39,27.0,ng0mm5

akanqfim,ccllaarence,"I've been trying to practice Galio in normals, and after ~80 games, I feel like I've accomplished nothing because the match quality is so poor that it doesn't provide meaningful experience outside of mechanical practice.

I'm Diamond II in ranked and have about 60% win rate in normals with thousands of games; I've been playing since season 1. Despite this, only maybe 1/10 of my normal matches contain two full teams of Diamond+ players.

The remaining matches are pre-made vs. pre-made, where there is maybe one Diamond/Master player on the enemy team (usually an ADC duo'd with a support), and everyone else is around Gold.

These games feel like a total waste of time. Abusing these players in lane doesn't help me learn the match ups.

It would be nice if it were possible to opt-out of being used to fill lower MMR teams. I'd rather sit in queue for 15-20 minutes and do something else on the side than waste 20 minutes in a game I don't want to be in.",2021-05-20 13:54:22,0.0,ngs9lp

5do849a5,EpicWizardGuy2771,"Ok to preface this, I of course don't really ever expect this to be a thing, but it would be really cool. These are also all visual changes, so nothing crazy. And with Annie and Fiora in here, they could even be called 'Cosplay' or something.

Standing Sett (Support) - Jotaro 

P- When Sett punches, he gets Ora sound effects. This would give auto attacks audible ques (I don't know if that matters) but more importantly it would also make attack speed Sett viable out of sheer awesomeness. Also, as Sett gains grit, he starts getting that yellow flame aura from the final episodes of the season.

Q- When Sett punches with Q, his punches blur, nothing too fancy.

W- The true damage area is Star Platinum punching through, the rest stays the same.

E- Star Platinum reaches out from behind Sett to pull in.

R- (The most ambitious) Sett steps aside into the classic Jojo stance, while SP does the body slam. On reentry Sett blinks over to the landing site to start punching again.

Taunt- Yare yare

&#x200B;

Standing Swain (ADC) - Joseph (old ofc):  Swain is both old and has an off left hand, so it works perfectly!

P- The ravens would just be pigeons, the common bird of NY. When he pulls people it would be purple tendrils.

Q and E- Again, just Hermit Purple.

W- The animation for Swain doing W is he pulls out a Polaroid camera and smashes it. The eye is purple and when the damage/slow goes off, the circle flashes like a camera flash.

R- More HP. He probably doesn't need wings, just flying around is cool.

Taunt- Oh my GOOOOOOOOD (in the subbed voice of course.)

&#x200B;

Standing Annie (Mid) - Avdol

Q, W, and E already fit, just add Magician's Red behind it. And R is Magician's Red. Not too much to make up here

Taunt- Tibbers ""Annie?"" Annie ""Yes, I AM."" with the necessary motions to emphasize.

&#x200B;

Standing Fiddlesticks (or Kayn, i prefer Fid, Jg): Kakyoin: A lot of Kakyoin's abilities are just Hierophant green doing something, so that might make his hitbox confusing if they think HG is the player idk .

P- The passive scarecrows look like Fid for the enemy, but Hierophant Green for the allies

Q- Not too much to say, just HG lashing out.

W- HG spreads out to replace the tendrils, draining their life.

E-  HG slashes, the animation for this has Fid take out a pad of paper and make a slash like when we first meet Kakyoin in the show.

R-  HG goes all aroung, like on the plane or in Josephs brain, emerald splashes are whirling in the circle.

Taunt- \*pulls out cherry\* Lelolelolelolelolelolelolelo... 

&#x200B;

Standing Fiora (Top) - Polnareff

Similar to Annie, all the moves are pretty much the same, when she Parries, Silver chariot blocks, and a vital can have an SG poke for more oomph.

Taunt- ""Tre Bi-en, Tre bien""

  
Standing Darius (Enemy Top) - Dio

P- Darius attacks with a stop sign, like from the final duel. Same bleed effect.

Same thing for the rest of his abilities, he just has a street sign, and says MUDAMUDA with each strike.

R- Darius tosses aside his sign, and pulls a bulldozer from the ground, for a ROADAROLLA finisher.

c88g9f96,KEKKUU,"This could be controversial but I found this interesting data in Korean LOL community-

Number of games played after game 4 in Rumble Stage (Game 5-6)

RNG - **0**

PSG, C9, DWG, MAD, PGG - 4

This could be controversial, due to time difference, LPL and LCK fans had to watch Rumble Stage at midnight and Riot might considered those while planning a schedule. However LPL fans could go to bed earlier(only 2 games after 1 am) while LCK fans had to wait till 2 am to watch the team that they root for. What about others?

Waiting term between 2 games in each day

RNG

1 game - Four times

2 games - Once

3 games - **None**

PSG

1 game - Thrice

2 games - None

3 games - **Twice**

C9

1 game - Thrice

2 games - Once

3 games - Once

DWG

1 game - Twice

2 games - Twice

3 games - Once

MAD

1 game - Once

2 games - Thrice

3 games - Once

PGG

1 game - Once

2 games - Thrice

3 games - Once

After their first game, RNG only had to wait for a single game for their next battle, and leave eariler. They never waited for 3 games, while other teams had to wait for 3 games at least once. PSG even waited twice.

Not saying that RNG is immoral, they are one of the strongest team currently in MSI and I love every single RNG players.

I also have some questions about laning and teamfighting with sylas

&#x200B;

Laning; 

\- What level/item should i have before trading with a range mage such as syndra or someone who is a lane bully?

\- Who are my biggest counters (who should i ban)

\- Who do i do well against

\- Blind pickable?

\- Fastest way to shove wave and roam?

\- Goal of sylas in lane against melee

\- Goal of sylas in lane against a range

Teamfighting; 

\- What is my job as sylas during teamfights

\- Am i able to split push effectively?

\- When are my powerspikes? (Level and item)

\- Do i scale well?

\- How do i do against tanks

\- Build path for tank heavy teams?

And pay attention since the abilities are basically a second aphelios. And yes, all of his abilities are based on the lore I made (eeeeh, kind of)



PASSIVE (invisible link): zethra possesses the knowledge of nearby enemies through a spiritual link.A warning blink accompanied with an audio whisper is recieved when enemy abilities come off cooldown. Zethra also gains a buff that counters enemies he goes against that increases with his own level . For ex:

1) he gains increased tenacity against morgana and xin Zhao. 


2) he receives reduced damage from chain ap abilities against akali or lux




Q ability- soulbind

: passive - when zethra kills or helps kill an enemy his soul becomes bound to theirs. Any debuff or cc zethra receives is transfered to bound enemies (though hard cc breaks the bind). Any buff or heal that bound enemies recieve is transfered to zethra(the cc, debuff and buff tranfer will not work after a certain range). Bound enemies also give a very small percentage of their stats to zethra. 


Active (im rlly srry to tell you that it has 2 parts): 

1st part(comes in 2 stacks): zethra creates an explosion on the ground. Enemies caught in the explosion recieve dmg and have a piece of their soul broken and sent to zethra which heals him and the zethra has 2 choices 

A) use the ability on himself which heals him and binds him to the enemy

B) use the ability on another enemy which binds them both together and transfers damage and debuffs between them.

2nd part-(soul acreation): send out a comet-like shape that deals dmg. The commet can have new effects added (more on that in his E)






W ability- hallowed state

Zethra dashes a fixed distance and temporarily transforms into a spirit (yes he is a human) pulling out a scythe (that deals dmg that scales with AP) and gaining increased movement speed when moving towards low hp enemies.





E. Bounty hunter


Passive: zethra gains stats from the items that his victims buy. He can also convert these stats into their counterparts in the shop (hp --> dmg  armor --> ad pen)




Active: zethra can cycle through bound enemy abilites and choose one of them. The chosen ability will have its effects placed on zethras Q.





R ability- ruination

Zethra enhances all his abilities in the following fashion


Passive: increases buff effects and can have more than one active at a time now


Q: automatically binds everyone in a range to him and increases percentage of stolen stats and massively reduces cooldown


W: increases dash distance traveled and adds the mov speed buff permenantely


E. Increases item stats percentage to 80%",2021-05-20 07:03:50,0.0,ngjyxo

Basically it's implying that the Mundo Rework would be fully revealed either this week (Unlikely considering it's already tuesday), or next week at most (Where it would be the week where they will reveal new skins since it's two weeks after the Project skin reveal).

9yhx12ga,starrank5,"These players should not be allowed to play until they understand basic mechanics and basic strategies. Every summoner should understand basic areas to ward in the lane phase. They should know to buy at least one control ward per game. Support champions should know to get an oracle lens and to purchase sup items and to help adcs to get kills and not to take them for themselves. They should know killing dragons and rifts are ways to get edge on the other team. They should know that after lane phase that they still need to cs and not walk past it for kills. They should know after getting kills not to recall but to damage turrets. If an enemy ward is killed or recently expired, they should know to leave the area. They should know which runes and items to buy each game. They should know if they are full health/have 1100-1300 gold to recall. They should know which champions to attack first in fights. When I play lol with other people that mock me for telling a few of these things in a game, is very frustrating. When they don't know basic stuff it upsets me. I don't think Riot really knows the difference from inexperienced players vs those who don't know how to play the game or even those may even feed with intent or are griefing but it looks like they are playing normal with out experience. I see it like a game of chess. The basics of chess is to know how all the pieces move. Its to know that the more pieces you capture and the less you lose the closer you are to winning the game. Its to know when you checkmate the king you win. An unexperienced player against another unexperienced player will not have much strategy, so they will move pieces around trying to capture pieces and to not to lose pieces. Same in lol, summoners should know not to get killed, they should know that they need to use gold to be strong enough to push back the enemy to destroy turrets and kill dragons, until they get the nexus",2021-05-20 15:56:53,0.0,ngu6gq

Runes: RESOLVE.

1: Guardian

2: Font of life

3: Second Wind

4: Revitalize

2nd Runes: SORCERY

1: Transcendence

2: Manna flow band or gathering storm.

I mostly use manaflow band cuz it lets me spam my E more often.

I would even be able to spam my E just to give my ADC bruh some speed boost and waste my mana like this.

&#x200B;

At the begining of the game i would buy 2 fiery charms and upgrade my E ""heal"".

The order with skills goes like this... i mostly prioritize W , and then upgrade my E... till ult is aviable. I sometimes ignore my ULT upgrade if it is not required and just upgrade my W and E till my ult would really be necesary

Now around lvl 5 - 6 i have money to buy third fiery charm and forbidden idol.

And with that i would go back to lane and farm with my bot adc till i have money for ""ardent cancer"" xd

Now when i have ""ardent cancer"" i usualy go for staff of flowing water or chemtech putrifier. Mostly staff of flowing watter first ... i sometimes put chemtech as last and instead of it buy """"""shurelyas battlesong or moonstone renewer"""""" ((((It depends... if my team wants more heal ... I would go for moonstone and if ADC i would go for battlesong)))). But i aint putting chemtech as last that often. and then if the game still didnt end , i would buy Redemption

So the finnal build is:

Ardent cancer.

Staff of flowing fluid.

Chemtech terrifyer.

isyn9jo,Throzagg,"I genuinely think Riot can't understand what's the problem with Senna and how to address it. Every time I see a nerf I just can't understand how they keep missing totally the main points and why is Senna a problem in high elo / pro play.  

You can take a look at the announced [changes](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/nfkrgg/patch_1111_preview_full_changes/). Summarizing, Riot is nerfing her Frostfire Gauntlet build, which I agree is a problem. Riot has clearly stated they don't want Senna to be a range tank abuser, specially considering she doesn't need to farm to also get extra range and damage.   

The point is how they are nerfing her stats, reducing the extra range per mists (25 >> 20), and introducing some weird AP scaling (which may bring new hybrid builds to be nerfed in the future again).  

The problem is how they keep allowing support Senna to be way better than the ADC version. I agree you should be able to play a support version, totally oriented around trading in lane, getting mists and eventually scaling good. The point is, currently, a support Senna gets more gold (support item + mist gold) than the ADC farming. So she just gets double value in the game: the mist aparition odds (for non farmed minions), combined with the 8g per mist allows her to get items really quickly. But the amount of mists she gets also gives a lot of powerful stats (mainly the extra range every 20 mists).  

So, why riot keeps nerfing Senna hitting the ADC version? Senna just will be unplayable until some weird new AP/hybrid build is discovered, and eventually she will be nerfed again. Can't they just balance her support version without touching her as ADC?",2021-05-19 17:50:11,6.0,ng1hhh

How exactly riot ranks the regions is unknown afaik, but they will consider the performance at the most recent international events (i think at some point it was last 4 tournaments, don't know how it's weighted though). 
Anyways, here a quick overview how the Top regions performed since 2018.
Example how to read this table: At Worlds 2020 the best performing chinese team got second, the second best top 4 (semis) and the thrid best team made top 8 (quarter finals)

Worlds 2018 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 16 | 2 | 4 | 16

Worlds 2020 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 4 | 8 | 16 

Not included are the 4th seeds from CN/EU at Worlds 2020 which didnt make it out of groups/play ins.

RNG entered the Rumble Stage having not lost a single game during the Groups Stage. The team’s first match was against Damwon KIA, who is regarded as a favorite of the tournament alongside RNG. This was a highly anticipated match and many expected this game to be a preview of the MSI Finals. In draft, RNG chose to capitalize on Gala’s excellent form and locking in the Kai’sa/Nautilus duo. This allowed Gala to play a comfort pick of his that also created the Pentakill highlight in the LPL Spring Finals against FPX. For Ming, the Nautilus pick also aligned with his tendency to look for roams, engage, and make plays around the map. This bot duo was a focus in draft for RNG in many of their games later on as well. In comparison, DK drafted a very unusual comp with no AP damage output at all. At the same time, RNG was actually down in total gold for the majority of the game. However, RNG made a pivotal decision to go Baron after DK had to base from a Dragon fight. At the same time, DK’s main tank in Khan’s Sion was also dead. At this moment in the game, RNG was actually even in gold with DK. Furthermore, by going to Baron, RNG forced DK to take a disadvantageous fight or lose the objective with no other significant resources to swap it for. As a result, RNG was able to take Baron and win the teamfight. The Baron-empowered minions allowed RNG to push and end the game. Cryin’s Orianna finished the game with a 7/0/8 scoreline and the highest KP on his team. 

**A Bump in the Road?**

RNG took their first loss at the MSI tournament against PSG. In draft, RNG opted to first pick Gala’s Kai’sa. However, PSG were well aware and had intentionally let this through. The PCS team knew that the Kai’sa without the Nautilus was a significantly weaker threat than the Kai’sa with one. Therefore, PSG was able to split up the Kai’sa Nautilus duo by letting RNG first pick the Kai’sa but then locking Nautilus Tristana in their first round. As a result, PSG was able to weaken the threat of Gala’s Kai’sa but also secure a meta-ADC in Tristana. While this game was a loss for RNG, it can be viewed as a win in terms of adapting future drafts. In this game, RNG saw the importance of prioritizing the Nautilus pick, especially when they want to pair it with a Kai’sa. This is reflected by the fact Nautilus was picked for three of RNG’s next five matches. Furthermore, the only time (vs C9) that the Nautilus pick lost was when RNG did not lock in an ADC in the same round of picks as the Nautilus. During that game, RNG had to pick the Xayah after Kai’sa Leona was locked in by C9. Thus, there was a very awkward interaction where Nautilus wants to engage and go forward but Xayah prefers staying back.

**Onward and Focused**

Going forward, RNG should prioritize their botlane picks in draft. Not only are Ming and Gala in great form, the importance of dragon-stacking and soul also means that botlane is naturally more integral to winning a game. To a certain extent, prioritizing either a Morgana or Rumble pick could actually be dropped for an Udyr pick. At the same time, considering that the upcoming matches will be Bo5s, it is also crucial for RNG to develop an alternative to this bot-focused draft strategy. RNG’s first Bo5 will be against PSG Talon. Considering that the two teams went 1-1 in the Rumble Stage, this series should also be extremely competitive and exciting to watch. Not only has PSG been willing to match RNG in the skirmish-heavy, kills-packed thriller, “LPL” style of play, but the players on each team have also demonstrated tremendous individual mechanics to get some solo bolos in. I for one am sold on RNG taking the series, not just against PSG Talon, but actually going all the way. RNG has proven they're capable of beating the (likely) second-favorite DK, and I think the few games RNG stumbled in were just limit-testing games of sort. So, who ya got?",2021-05-19 19:35:28,3.0,ng3eji
n7e27y5,tytyos,"DISCLAMER: i am proposing here a system update, before you comment '' But X champion wuld be broken'' i know changes like this would warrant individual champion tweaks. 

I've been seing a lot of discussions about how healing from champion kits feels really bad against 60% wounds, especially in the case of enchanters (mostly soraka tbf). 

Currently, heal and shield power works like this. :

> Heal Power stacks additively with itself, but multiplicatively with other heal modifiers.

What about making it interact additively with other sources ? For those who don't really visualize the change, here is a little example:

For instance lets say Soraka has 30% increased heal power, and her base heal value is 100.
If the target isn't affected by grievous wounds, her heal is 130, with both the current system and my proposition. 
Now lets say the target is affected by 60% grievous wounds. With the current iteration of heal power, soraka would heal for 52 (100x1.3x0.4).

With my proposition, soraka would heal for 70. (100x(1.3-0.6)).



Essentially this would give enchanters a way to scale their healing without being affected as much by grievous wounds, without changing their healing when no GW is involved. (this doesn't address the power of ignite against them early on however). 

Bonus: make it work the same with serpent fang shield reduction",2021-05-19 04:44:47,31.0,nflq0e

1g85unng,monosolo830,"One game I just had in which I queued up as mid myself.

5 mins into the game, enemy jgl ganked mid twice, both mid/jgl flash + mid ignite, got first blood.

Meanwhile my jgl camps our toplane Malphite, still Malphite goes 0-2

I survived 5 more ganks in mid while solo killing enemy mid, winning my lane, taking mid turret.

Our top/bot hard losing, lost both turrets, still our jgl only helps top/bot, not my lane which is the only lane winning.

We ended up winning the game, luckily, because our jgl and I were basically 2v5.

But then I couldn't understand why this jgl only camps the losing lane, while letting my winning lane hard camped by enemy jgl. Well, you guessed right, enemy mid/jgl duo, our jgl/top duo.

This is just really unfortunate. I played the game so much better and if our jgl focuses my lane we would have an easy win, however premades are premades, they help each other no matter what.

And that could have easily resulted in a loss for us. And it really isn't fair for a solo player to lane against someone who duos with jgl.

And this can simply be fixed by removing duo from soloq, so that it is fair for everyone.",2021-05-19 05:00:32,25.0,nfm4d1

Therefore by adding %Heal/Shield power per mist, or maybe per 20 mist, would be something an AP Senna would definitely want to harvest mist for.

90jitpen,YellingBear,"So I’ve been trying to figure out a version of Yuumi, where she no longer perma sticks to an ally.  My thought process is that she can still dash to an ally, and still sticks to them for a bit, but she will auto fall off after a few seconds (and not be able to reattach to the same ally for a certain amount of time).  I’m currently thinking something like level 1, 4 seconds attached and 20 second “debuff” where you can’t reattach, each point put into the skill increases the attach time by 1 second and lowers the “debuff” by 1 second.  So you end up at max with a 9 second attachment, and a 15 second “debuff”.  

So the question becomes, what buffs would she need to get to make this version of her viable?  I’m thinking that her poke would probably need to be control-able even when not attached, and maybe that means attached gets extra range.  Maybe her attachment buff would be stronger, so you really feel the power spike she gives when attached to an ally.  And probably lower mana costs (no longer need to offset for her being untargetable 95%+ of the game.)

I think this change would open up paths for Yuumi to be less ADC reliant, and thus effect the game in a more direct and meaningful way.  While also allowing the enemy team an actual champion they can interact with, instead of a super powered tumor that has latched on to the opposing bot laner.",2021-05-20 00:56:33,0.0,ngb0i0

But not only one guy, they nearly unified just shout and are angry on some choices the balance team makes. Now my question: if riot would see these streams (which I think at least some of them do), and take them seriously, couldn't they just hire one or two to look over their patches, in order to ""check"" them. I think I remember someone saying once that it is very obvious that riot doesn't play their game. So why not hire someone to deliver in-game experience?

Is it because some champs are just meant to be broken for a while in order to have a ""exciting"" meta of permabans and unplayable champ, or do they just not care?

c43e16c9,DrimPool,"The overreaction about Blaber performance this MSI is fucking insane! 

He had literally 2 bad moments all tournament long, the first was his flash for scuttle on Nidalee vs DK in their very first game. The second was his engage against PSG as Udyr onto the Leona.

Every other game Blaber played either average or absolutely smurfed. Like their most important wins where they beat both RNG and DK, both were because of Blaber smurfing in the early game, getting both Fudge AND Perkz ahead, guarding bot lane, and playing super smart and efficient all throughout the game, but ofcourse he never gets his props.

70sysnl6,Dull-Tomatillo-7690,"Hello. I've been playing the game for 8 years already, and really love the game, but in this time I've been gradually increasing my levels of toxicity. I tried every method to avoid using chat and disabling it, but nothing seems to work since it is as easy as reactivating it.

Only thing I can suggest is doing like gambling websites, that a player could self restrict himself (in this case, the chat disabling it completely) for the amount of time he choses, without being able to revert it. You would ask why, if we got the option of mute and disable chat ingame.

Answer is easy: that can work for some people for the first few games. After that, a negative stimulus can make us re-activate the chat in literally 4 seconds: options -> interface -> enable chat, and then the circle begins again.

I really tried third parties programs, like disabling my enter key with autohotkey, but again, takes me 10 seconds to just close the program with task manager.

Tried to do the reduce chat thing, but again, when your mind is out of control and you just want to be toxic, it takes literally less than 20 seconds to get the chat back and revert that solution.

&#x200B;

That's why I'm asking for a serious solution for people that can't contain the rage in moments like that. I know myself enough to know that if I get angry for something ingame, but couldn't flame to my teammates, I would just forget about it in 30 sec and go on without problems, but the problem will be still there if I have the option to talk.

&#x200B;

I know the change starts with me: I've been going to a psychologist for the last weeks because this rage attacks slowly become more and more casual in daily things, which I feel really bad about it and want to change it. But I really think Riot could also help us giving us the chance to disable chat completely without being able to activate it again in an amount of time of our choice, when we feel strong enough to make that step.

bv5vg,playhacker,"IIRC, the 4 teams in Pool 1 are the top 4 in MSI.   

MSI also gives the best performing 1-seed region a 2nd seed at worlds that is in Play-Ins.   
So LCO probably gets a 2nd seed in Play-Ins.  

Splitting Pool 2 into Pool 2 (Major Region) and 3 (Regions ""lower"" than Major and Higher than Wildcard) and changing Pool 3 to Pool 4 (play-in winners) is new from last year.  
If they keep to their [logic with the seeding changes last year](https://lolesports.com/article/2020-world-championships-regional-seed-allocation/blt39a37713a2014366) in awarding two major regions (among LCK, LCS, LPL, and LEC) a 4th seed, then they will give China and Korea 4 seeds since the Korea and China seeds had finished pretty high in back to back years at worlds ('19 & '20) with more LPL teams in Top 4 (2 in '19 and 2 in '20), and LEC not winning worlds in either year whereas LCK did in '20.   
Since Korea won last year their extra seed probably goes into Pool 2, then of their 4 seeds, 1 is in Pool 1, 2 is in Pool 2, and 1 is in Play-Ins. China's extra seed goes into Play-Ins.   

PCS (Previously LMS) generally gets 2 seeds both in Pool 3, but because of this years MSI, one of the PCS seeds would be in Pool 1  
VCS generally gets 1 seed in Pool 3  
Last year, LCK's 3rd seed got Pool 3 instead of Play-Ins because VCS didn't play  

Every major region gets at minimum 3 seeds usually.   
LEC remaining 2 seeds go into Pool 2 and Play-Ins.   
LCS 3 seeds most likely goes into Pool 3, Play-Ins, and Play-Ins since they can't be in Pool 1, and based on past int'l performance, they have to do a play-ins for their 2nd & 3rd seed and Pool 2&3 already is filled up.  

**So in theory, the regions in:    
Pool 1 is LCK1, LPL1, PCS1, LEC1  
Pool 2 is LCK2, LCK3, LPL2, LEC2  
Pool 3 is PCS2, LCS1, LPL3, VCS1   
Play Ins is LCS2, LCS3, LEC3, LPL4, LCK4, LCO1, LCO2, CBLOL, LCL, LJL, LLA, TCL**   

If VCS can't join worlds again because of COVID, then I'd imaging LEC3 gets the Pool 3 spot

I think it would be very interesting for the fans and useful for the major regions to play an MSI-like tournament between not the winner of the spring split but the runner-ups, the 2nd and 3rd team.

There's already something similar in football (soccer) where the best teams from national champioships play in Champions League and the runner-ups play in the UEFA Europa League.

It would be good for the fans because you'd see matches between teams that rarely have a chance to face each other.

It would be good for the regions because it will give the teams that don't get to play MSI a chance to face off against a different meta and develop their macro play.

It will also be a nice way to evaluate how strong a region actually is, because - arguably - the real strenght of a region is not so much the best team, which may be outliers, but those closer to the so-called middle of the pack.

I understand that there are a few reasons not to do it (time constraints, viewers fatigue) but with a shorter MSI, a short 8-teams tournament (2 teams from China, Korea, EU and NA) would be totally doable. Just make 2 groups of 4 teams, double round and then knockout stage.

Personally, I'd love to see it.",2021-05-19 22:16:17,0.0,ng70qu

As the title says. The only way to remove viability from frostfire on senna is to make it so she is forced to go I to melee range to proc it which then makes her an easy target to get bursted down and can use her advantages. Right now there are no no other users of this item that are ranged besides urgot and that really hurts urgots viability with this item, but on the contrary he can easily be in immolate range to proc it so this solves the issue of nerfing it away from senna while still leaving it viable for urgot.

Well by doing that, they also secured themselves the title. In every international tournament since 2017, Perkz either wins the whole thing or the team that eliminates him wins it. There has only been one exception.

* MSI 2017 : G2 loses the final against SKT.
* Worlds 2017 : G2 loses the 3rd game of Day 6 in the Group Stage against SSG, getting officially eliminated from the tournament. SSG went on winning the World Championship.
* MSI 2018 : The only exception.The only international event Perkz hasn't qualified for in his entire career.
* Worlds 2018 : G2 loses in the semifinals to eventual winners IG.
* MSI 2019 : G2 wins the tournament.
* Worlds 2019 : G2 loses the final against FPX. 
* Worlds 2020 : G2 loses in the semifinals to eventual winners DWG.

tl9z6,clg_wrath2,"Just have a list of things I hope, or I want LCS to do moving forward after another international performance that has lead many fans to be disappointed.

1. First and foremost set realistic narratives for LCS teams internationally. Stop trying to call or act as if the LCS is a major region, we are not. Acting this way only sets up LCS teams and fans for failure when realistic outcomes happens. (C9s MSI, no NA teams out of groups at worlds, last place in world groups, ext.)

2. Starting this off season make a rule that any new player (import or non academy talent) to the LCS have to enter a draft pool. This makes it that top imports cant automatically go/be signed to top orgs non stop. I imagine this will have 2 effects... 1 starts to evenly balance LCS rosters and 2 de-incentivized imports to keep coming to NA. Would perkz of came to NA if it meant being drafted by CLG? Probably not. 

3. Expand the league put to somewhere between 12-16 teams. This allows for more players to be in the main league, gain experience, create jobs and bring in some good orgs with fanbases. (Sentinels and faze come to mind)

4. Start to regionalize the league. Set up either an 2 conference system or if you have 16 teams a 4 division system. One of the reasons I feel NA has stunted growth is unless you are in LA/So cal you really have 2 chances a year to maybe see the LCS live. Regionalizing the LCS can open up new areas of the country to be more involved, gain attachment and grow the scene. This has worked well in other regions.


5. Stop making every freaking decision on rules and rosters about winning/worlds success. Try to focus on how you can make the LCS more enjoyable for fans every week. Im tired of top orgs not caring about anything LCS and only focusing on their international chances, which history shows is little to none. Focus on making the LCS a better product to take in, because that is what will make the league/scene live as long as it can.",2021-05-20 01:07:50,0.0,ngbarp
68oonws0,BadGenjiNoob,"I have been playing league daily for a couple of years now, and amassed over a thousand hours playing daily, and have wanted to quit for the past few weeks since I figured it really does not help my life. I tried and tried but I kept coming back because I had nothing better to do.

Today, I decided that I was no good for the community as I was a very inconsistent and often toxic, hardstuck gold player, and it would improve everyone’s experience if I simply left.

Today, I had a good game, and then a bad game which really tilted me and set me off the edge, and I thought, why not be really toxic and get my account banned. It had already been banned before for 2 weeks, and now I knew it would be permanent to, so I asked everyone to ban me, and here I am.

I may someday come back to it on a new account, however, starting today, hopefully I will try to improve my life for the better and quit league.
 
Many fun memories were made and I always played it with a really close friend, although he too found the game very tilting recently and I decided to quit, through force rather than sheer will.

7sbp73ib,Judgepepper2020,"If you had the craziest question that anybody can ask, what if you combine 2 mythic items? but first, let's talk about what are mythic items first. Mythic items are a new type of item that empowers your other items that are legendary items that give them mini stats or sub stats in other terms but you only need to have one mythic item per player every game,

&#x200B;

now that we know what mythic items are let us get to the main question "" what if you combine two mythic items?""

Answer - If you combine two mythic items then you would be broken in-game with two mythic passives per two mythic items and with their power passives they can create many combos that might break the game and deal a lot of damage.

List of Double mythic combos :

Liandry's Anguish  +  Luden's Tempest = Liandry's burning meteors of the Void

Turbo Chemtank  +    Shurelya's Battlesong  = Nitro Battle Tank

**Night Harvester**  \+   Hextech Rocketbelt  =  Soul Rocket Blaster Buckle

Luden's Tempest  +   Moonstone Renewer  =   Echos of the stars

**Everfrost**  \+  Imperial Mandate =  Subzero Command

Frostfire Gauntlet +  Liandry's Anguish = Buring True ice pool

Trinity Force  +  Divine Sunderer  = Divine sun breaker

15rfcq,BoostedTyrian,"Back in 2015, when the Project skinline was launched, it started the trend of adding boeders to the skin you bought under certain timeframes. At the time, if you bought Project Zed skin in a certain date, you could buy it cheaper (975 rp) and get the border. Those were super rare at the time.

Borders at the time were smaller due to the loading screen displaying the Mastery of the champion and the ranked season ""armor"" in the loading screen was thicker.

[Comparison between Project: Zed border and Project: Senna border](https://imgur.com/a/xxttFdg)

What i would like to achieve:

\- those directional clicks will be assigned to say NUMpad 1-9.  
\- This click emulation will not actually move the cursor in that direction, so the mouse can be used independently  to aim abilities.  
\- The clicks will ideally only be active, while the corresponding button is being held.

7d53c02d,Impact-Optimal,"In the LEC we pride ourselves on our seemingly endless supply of talented rookie players. Every split seems to produce at least one player of the caliber of Elyoya, Selfmade, Carzzy or Kaiser, that is to say, world class. The lower leagues (EUmasters and local competition like the German and Spanish scene) are a cheap source of talent which could net lower ranked teams the opportunity to climb to the top or the prospect of a big cash buyout from a North American team. It is therefore that almost every season the older players and ""failed"" future talent on the LEC teams have to make room for a new wave of rookie talent. And while a healthy competitive ecosystem needs an influx of talent from outside to stay on top, this has also led in the past to many teams abandoning very competent and sometimes even outstanding players in favor of unknown players in the hopes that a new Caps will emerge. Teams who seem to understand the importance of their strong core and replace only those players that not up for, or are on the lower end of the LEC competition have managed to climb their way to the top with impressive results. 

&#x200B;

Look at Rogue, the team started with Profit, Kikis, Sencux, Heaq and Wadid, but after they got their core of Larssan, Inspired and Vander, after each season they kept their core and actively sought to improve the positions they identified as weaknesses to end up with the roster they have today which only barely lost LEC finals this split. Aside from the loss of Vander this year this team always kept their strong core of players and sought better, known players to replace their weak links. Contrast that to SK, who had Crownshot, Zazee, Limit, Selfmade (of which Selfmade to be fair got an offer he couldn't refuse from Fnatic) and let all these players walk. Today their roster consists of Jenax, Tynx, Blue, Jezu and Treatz. Treatz is clearly the star of the team, but Blue and Jezu drop the ball from time to time. Zazee was a very competent mid laner who had a very impressive understanding of his duty on the map for a rookie, he would be an upgrade over many mid laners that played in the LEC last split. But he wasn't the new Caps so he had to be replaced with Blue, who right now has done very little to show that he deserves his spot in the LEC. And Nemesis is now streaming in Korea. 

&#x200B;

There is a good list of players that isn't in the LEC, but has proven their talent in the LEC up to the moment they were dropped by teams. Think of Nemesis, Crownshot (who got picked up again), Steeelback as support, Cabochard, a phenomenal top laner who would easily be top 3 if he got back again now that Bwipo is likely swapping to jungle, even Denyk, who finally got back to the LEC, was absent from the LEC when he had a great split with Misftis. 

&#x200B;

to summarize, 

In the LEC we have seemingly the opposite problem that the LCS has. Most of our lower end teams put to much trust in rookies and not enough trust in proven (not just veteran) talent in the league. Sure, bad players have also been recycled for for longer than is probably advisable. examples are Promisq  and Heaq in the past. But ones a player proves himself on the LEC stage than keeping a player like Nemesis over some unknown name from the rookies scene is simply a better move for both the organization and the LEC as a whole. Sure the LEC produces world class players each year, but for every Elyoya, there are 2 or 3 Blue's and Promisq's that end up havin to be replacing in the end.",2021-05-19 23:40:27,0.0,ng95nz

13urc5,MikusHaikus,"Riot recently expressed their disapproval on the new tank Senna builds. They talked about doing a mini-rework to make her fit better with lethality items. I was thinking about Senna and her unique playstyle as a weird support/adc mix champion and i came up with, in my opinion, an interesting idea for a mini-rework for her.

 

**The concept**

Make Senna synergize with two different items builds but in different ways. She can either build ability power enchanter items and turn into a true support with bigger heals, bigger shield but less damage. The other option would be building lethality and attack damage items and turning into a second adc. This way you can decide in the course of the game if your team needs a support or maybe they are all feeding and its time to carry. It would kind of work like Kayn but with build path instead of a evolve.

&#x200B;

**The execution**

**P - Absolution**

Turn the bonus AD into bonus adaptive damage.

**Q - Piercing Darkness**

Reduce or remove the AD scaling on the healing and increase the damage ad scaling.

**W - Last Embrace**

Make the root duration scale with AP, similar to how Janna’s slow intensity scales with AP.

**E - Curse of the Black Mist**

Make the duration of the camouflage and also the range of the mist scale with AP.

R - Dawning Shadow

Increase shielding ap ratio, remove damage ap ratio, increase damage ad ratio.

   
 

**Possible drawbacks**

While I myself think this concept would be cool I can see possible balancing difficulties. It is possible it is a nightmare to balance both build paths equally, so the meta would always be either AP or AD build. It is also possible the players would go hybrid picking up the most powerful items from each build path and ignoring the others.

**TL;DR: Make Senna be able to choose building ap and becoming a support, or building ad and becoming a carry, similar to how Kayn chooses to be a bruiser or an assassin.**",2021-05-19 01:41:45,7.0,nfh0ub

9bc6x4eu,iliektristana,"As a mid Tristana and Lucian player I'm pretty hyped for the new midlane marksman that was recently mentioned in the [dev champ roadmap](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/champion-roadmap-april-2021/), and as a result I did a tiny bit of research and found some info that I didn't see published anywhere yet, which I thought I'd share.

What has been published (what we know) so far:

\- Coming this summer- Champ is a ""Sentinel of Light""  
\- The only living Sentinel of Light is Daowan  
\- Daowan is mentioned in a 2019 short story called [Voices of the Dead](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/Senna-color-story/)  
\- Champ is intended to appeal to ""a lot of mid lane assassin and skirmisher players ""

What I've found from reading the short story:

\- Daowan is a female and was Anabal's apprentice  
\- Daowan has Anabal's relic stone (??) and wields a glaive (in the short story)

&#x200B;

My conclusion, based on the information available to me, is ***that Daowan will wield a*** [***glaive***](https://www.google.com/search?q=glaive&sxsrf=ALeKk011bS4yXzx6hCyuiNKJcmhWik1E4A:1621360086358&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx7v__5NPwAhXPY98KHYu_B8YQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=1007) ***that can be used for ranged autos as well as close-ranged melee attacks (similar to Samira except with the dash to be used on terrain)***. This fits in with the fact that she also seems to have a [grappling hook](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt731acb42bb3d1659/bltd482d7b0e9c550ca/607e2c5492f0063e5c070b95/4_26_2021_ChampRoadmapApril2021Article_06_Mid_Marksman_Teaser.jpg), so it makes sense that she would be incentivized to get into melee range in some situations. This also fits in to what riot said about her ""appealing to midlane assassin and skirmisher players"".

That's it. [Thanks for reading](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/021/work.jpg). I welcome different takes or theories! Let's see how this ages lol.",2021-05-19 02:25:24,7.0,nfi5eu

6z1rm,color_shot,"People love to create narratives, and perhaps 2020 worlds made it a given, but NA performed very well and people should really put their finish into perspective.

  **The NA team finished top 5 in the world.** This happened while beating the world champions along with every other major region during the competition. Was any of this seen as possible during Faker's reign? Of course not. Korea was an unstoppable force and if anything MSI has shown the gap between all regions has diminished significantly. 

  **The NA team had players from 5 different countries and 3 different continents, the majority with little international experience.**

  Blaber shared time with Svenskeren and played very little during his only other world competition. He was seen then as having a below average performance, so his inconsistency, gut check, and amount of games played throughout this tournament will play a huge role in his development. 

  The same can be said about Fudge and Vulcan, who each played on lackluster teams during their single worlds' runs, and had a combined total of 10 international games. Despite this, they had the best performances during their team's runs, both looking like they are top 5 or higher in their respected roles.

  It is difficult for teams with just two foreign players to create synergy in just a few months, however C9 managed to merge these players from all different backgrounds and turn it into a top 5 world competition team, despite NA's current reputation and their carries' atypical performances.

**Growth:** It was clear from January that Fudge needed some time to develop as a top laner. Many analysts believed he was a bottom tier LCS player. Blaber also clearly needed some time to adapt to being a world level player, because the mistakes he was making don't happen even on a gold level clash team. Given the amount of international games he's played now, on a brand new jungle meta that he is likely not fully accustomed to, perhaps his performance in a few months time will be night and day from what we saw this month. 

  These players aren't even accustomed to playing on the same region, let alone on the same team, so perhaps they need more time to adjust. We've seen Perkz, Zven, and Blaber play much better for years than they played this month, and despite this, they were still able to beat every major reason in at least one game.

  I'd like to also reference G2. They only swapped one player, who is a world finalist and a homegrown EU talent, yet they are looking worse than they have in years. Surely they will grow as a team, and its safe to say C9's many players will grow as well. And finally..

  **..was C9 even supposed to be at MSI?** I say this because there is a case to be made that this isn't even the best team in North America. C9 made it to MSI through extorting the lack of synergy between TL's 1st year import and a substitute jungle, first blooding him all 5 games, and finally by cheesing through a Sion jungle laneswap. Does this take away from C9's wins? No. But does this reflect on TL's 5 man roster? Can we say with certainty that with the cards on the table C9 would have beaten the real TL? Of course not.

  For these reasons, I believe the current sentiment is greatly understating NA's potential as a region. Saying NA is out of world trophy contention for even the next 3 years is a great exaggeration of the turmoil. NA certainly has the potential to create a top 4 team, and could even contest for the trophy in the near future, especially given the amount of imported world caliber talent. Players like POE, Impact, Ssumday, Aphro, and Johnson should not be forgotten either, despite their teams' lack of success, and I'll end it here. If you read it, thank you, and if not:

  Tldr: NA is okay, can get good",2021-05-19 23:44:56,0.0,ng99mz
c43e16c9,DrimPool,"I have absolutely no problem with Caedrel other than his blatant bias' against NA players. 

On his vod review of C9 vs RNG, he fails to give Blaber his props and recognition for his smart pathing, and ganks that ultimately won C9 the game vs RNG. Blaber made so many smart decisions that game to get his laners ahead, made tons of good engages and had immaculate team fighting with his team. But instead of Caedral giving him his props other than saying ""it was smart"", he starts claiming it's not jungle diff, Blaber just used the enemy's vision against them lol. If this was any other jungler the consensus would be ""jungle diff"". 

When a jungler wins you the game by doing all the right things which Blaber did, why would it not be jungle diff. using the enemy's vision against them is part of what being a good jungler is. But ofcourse he has to take a dump on Blaber every chance he gets. He praises Elyoya when he does the most basic jungling, but when Blaber makes crucial game winning plays he ignores it and makes excuses about it. Blaber had literally 2 bad games the entire MSI, the first was his flash for sucttle as Nidalee. The second was his engage onto leona as udyr in the PSG game, those 2 moments did put C9 behind even further in those games. (Granted Perkz himself played really bad in the PSG game getting solo killed by Maple and dying to ganks, that play from Blaber was still a bad).

Apart from these 2 bad plays Blaber made he played every game smarter than most junglers, he almost always gained an early lead and transitioned it into a win for his team. Crucially the most important wins against the top 2 teams (RNG and DK) in the tournament was a result of Blaber being a huge factor for C9 at all stages of the game.

When C9 lost to Mad because of a 3v3 river crab play, all the blame was put onto Blaber, saying he got outjungled when in fact it was a bad team play that caused the loss. You never heard once Caedral denying people claiming jg diff, nor did he clarify it wasn't Blaber's fault. But in the PSG game where MAD lost because of a lvl 1 play by PSG and River on Udyr completely ran away with the game, was perma in Elyoya's jungle the entire game, Caedral makes sure to state that it wasn't Elyoya's fault. Caedral was also a pro jungler so my thoughts is jealousy because Blaber is an NA jungler that has a lot of hype behind him, 1v9ing the whole split for C9, 2 time MVP and rookie of the split. Winning C9 their 2 biggest games at MSI. He never gives Blaber his credit, it seems he's just happy to tear to him down.

Both Zven and Fudge said in interveiws that Blaber has been recieving way too much of the blame from the community for things that's not even his fault, but C9's as a whole.",2021-05-20 00:17:19,0.0,nga256

d210m,Electro522,"And to get the obvious out of the way: yes, I do report them when necessary, and yes, I should just ""gEt GuD"".

But, let's talk about in the moment, in the game. You go into laning phase, feeling good, coming off of a win streak, only to quickly realize that you are horribly outmatched.

They're easily outfarming you while still consistently harassing you, they're dodging skillshots you normally land, and they're pulling off combos that other players in your elo can only dream of.

You pull back under your tower, and try to farm the best you can, while still getting harassed every time you take a step forward. You're forced to back far earlier than you'd like, and once you come back to lane for the first time.....you get tower dove and killed. It only gets worse from there as even half a screen behind your tower doesn't even feel safe, you fall further and further behind, the smurf pushes their advantage to the rest of the map, snowballing his team, and you get blamed for feeding.

I know that pretty much everyone Plat and below has experienced this (and I'm pretty sure even Diamond players experience it on a regular basis). So.....what can you do? Is there any way, in that moment, to at least slow them down? Like asking for more ganks, or telling the jungler to ignore your lane? Do you try your best to farm, or just take what you can with your longest range ability? And then do you just sacrifice your tower, since you can't even survive under it?

I know that it's an uphill battle from the get go, and any possible solution only delays the inevitable. Your only real hope is that the rest of the enemy team is much worse than you are, forcing the smurf into a literal 1v9 situation, which some, if not most, are not good enough to handle.

But if there is any form of strategy or gameplan to overcome them, and show them that they probably belong in the elo they so graciously visited.......what would it be?",2021-05-19 17:20:52,0.0,ng0zt9

I've only been playing league since the tail end of S9 and ABSOLUTELY LOVE playing Xerath...to the point I've hit 660K mastery on him.... now, while I get his damage is CRAZY, I'm starting to notice his one shortcoming - consistently beating AD Assassins(more specifically Zed) and Master Yi, just because his Q range is the same as my E....so hitting him with CC is easier said than done, and before people come at me with the ""you suck at the champ then"" comments - my WR on Xerath is 56% at 600 games, which I truthfully think is quite okay.

&#x200B;

So upon looking back at what Xerath used to do for his abilities and passive, his passive then seemed to suit him more as a champion, and given the state of the game currently I thought I'd admit, I feel as though compared to his current passive: it would suit him better now more than it did back then. 

&#x200B;

I say this with 100% honesty as I feel that his damage is great, his range is great, and his mana use is great as well if you consider the damage he does(assuming you don't absolutely burn your mana) I personally would like to see the old passive come back. Again given the current state of the game and items like Kraken slayer, even after the buffs he just received he still feels like he falls through the cracks and can't compete when he gets Q R ignited by champs like Zed for 100% of his healthbar and barrier at level 6. 

&#x200B;

Also given the only item that really is built being Zhonyas Hourglass(granting a max of 75 armour) really doesn't help into the late game when you look at how strong lethality items are.

&#x200B;

My proposition to Riot: Integrate Xeraths old passive back into his kit and tweak it to 25, 30 or 35% of Bonus AP is converted into armour. OR! Reduce the mana regen values on autos by 50% and incorporate the bonus armour at 15%?",2021-05-19 16:18:16,0.0,nfzz5d

k2l09qe,TheLoreWriter,"At this point, just about every champion release is disappointing, frustrating, or outright demoralizing. Either ugly visuals or painfully annoying voices tied to abilities that were probably reskinned versions of an earlier champion's design seems to be the norm. Seraphine and Samira are only the worst offenses in that regard, with what should have been a sona rework being released as a kpop skin with *the worst* justifications for their kits similarities, while Samira takes the most annoying elements of Katarina and Yasuo, and tunes them up with guns.

A handful of champs in the last few years make exceptions to this, such as Sett, but overall, its like each champion is released with more thought going into how flashy they are going to look for pro play than being a positive addition to the game's roster. Meanwhile champions with outdated kits are left to get overtaken by whatever new mashup has come out in the last year, or they're casually borrowed from to provide the newcomer with a workable ability. We have a huge disparity between the overly complex gameplay of new champions and the overly simple approach of these older ones.

I recognize that the game itself has undergone some enormous changes since its early days, with faster paced action being the trend, but this focus seems to have cut down the quality of the champions as an opposing player. The experience of facing them ends up as 15 minutes of unpleasant slog until laning phase ends when they hit their power spike and ace your team. 

The champion list is up to 155 at this point and I've noticed this drop in quality of experience as far back as Zoe. The roster would be a lot better off if there was fewer champion releases and more of the reworks and updates to help fix many of the issues that leave the earlier champions unable to keep up with recent additions.",2021-05-19 16:39:56,0.0,ng0bie

I've also heard people say ADC is a role like support, where the higher elo you go, the less coin flip the lane is and your teammates acctaully play around you if you're fed (such as peeling you etc)

So i'm assuming ADC is a good role for higher elos, but how about low elo? Can adc be a role that can consistently win games without it being a coin flip game? Is it possible to carry your support/just farm it out 9cs/min and carry the game?",2021-05-19 07:53:50,0.0,nfq6cf

7ory0w2o,Maurichio1,"I haven't given this a great deal of thought, but from what i have seen, i think targetable abilities on champions should get a massive buff in their damage (like Karma Q, Ahri Q+E, Caitlyn Q+E, Jinx Q etc.) while champions that rely almost entirely on ""locked on"" abilities like Tristana R and bomb, Zed Ult, Veigar ult, Gankplank Q etc. should get massive nerfs.

As an Ahri main, every time i play Q or E, the risk / reward balance seems...well...unbalanced. If i miss the attack, i lose a significant amount of mana and enter a long cooldown period. If i land the spells, wether the damage is enough to outweigh the negatives is arguable. Plenty of times i can recall where i all in a support with 1400 hp and 28 mr, landing every spell in my kit only for them to survive with barely any hp. If i am taking all this risk and yet barely manage to kill the weakest of supports (unless i have 2-3 endgame items) then what is the point of playing these champions?

Contrast that with Zed. Aside from the fact he has no mana cost and therefore no real penalty for spamming shurikens, his all ins are 99% of the time undodgables and deal massive damage that will most likely kill you. Same thing with LeBlanc, her TP AoE range is big enough to be practically undodgable in the hands of an average player and then landing a combo dealing massive damage again (the so called burst champs). Tristana jumps on you (AoE damage = almost undodgable), locks a bomb on you and proceeds to vaporize you with basics and a yet again non targeted ult.

Vayne for example who needs a lot of skill to play properly, has all of her targetable abilties (essentially her Q) affect her mobility, while everything else just amps her damage a bit. But against an equal tristana, she gets booted cause trist doesn't need to target anything, just point and click on vayne and gg while vayne has to think about positioning, her momentary stealth roll with ult, her E usage etc.

Anyway, just a few thoughts i had on the matter, the text is a bit all over by i hope you can get my point.",2021-05-19 18:56:29,0.0,ng2n10
r1trj,Feenrir,"Why do minions behave like in this clip of loltyler1's stream? Watch the melee minion changing its target twice before dying to the turret and almost fucking up a last hit not to mention potentially breaking a freeze if it were one.

Why does this happen? Is there rng involved in this that is not communicated by riot? Following the league of legend wiki's statements quoted below, I don't see why it would change targets twice in a single second:

>When minions find several enemy units they choose their target using a priority system that follows this order:

1. Enemy champions attacking an allied champion.
2. Enemy minions attacking an allied champion.
3. Enemy minions attacking an allied minion.
4. Enemy turrets attacking an allied minion.
5. Enemy champions attacking an allied minion.
6. The closest enemy minion.
7. The closest enemy champion.

>Once a minion has chosen a target, it only switches to a new target if the new target has higher priority. If they see a new target with the same priority as their current target, they keep attacking their current target.",2021-05-18 21:03:47,6.0,nfa6rv

14q27zy,Barb0ssaEUW,"The people [decided](https://i.imgur.com/oeHksFc.png) on which role is the **weakest** in this patch and it obviously refers to Solo Q and how much impact it has. 

To be very clear, no one would argue against any role's strength if it is viewed from an individual standpoint. But we all know that a certain role is just unable to really shine in Solo Q based on the fact that it is completely dependent on Support synergy, match up, its own team comp and the enemies, what priority junglers set and how the game develops. There are so many factors which influence this role to be not just viable, but at the end of the day impactful.

16f57n,ScottUminga," Just a few thoughts.

Why doesn't Corki get full or half stacks on his R when he reaches 6?

**R-Missile Barrage**

I imagine when you're in lane and you just reach 6, would it not be opportune for R to be at max or at least 3 stacks? Corki has to wait an additional 20 seconds to get the large missile. Or go back to base to get full stacks.

In comparison there is Shyvana and she immediately get her R energy at max.

Personally I think it would be cool if R's third rocket had a knock-back like graves passive along with the burst AOE explosion.

**W - Special Delivery - INNATE - THE PACKAGE:** After **8:00**

I actually really like this skill, but there's something about the knockback and the displacement of champs, pending on where they are standing. I imagine it should kind of be like a Rumble R or a Cass W but your upclose and personal. So wouldn't it make sense for the enemy champion to be standing on the trail getting burned and slowed instead of being knocked off the trail where there only getting hit for the initial tick.

My thoughts here is to put the CC of a knockback on the third missile in his R for the purposes of keeping enemies away or cancelling channels. And W - Special Delivery to keep its slow, but have enemies within its trail taking in damage. And potentially having it a little easier to lob a Q , cone E, and R into a group that is together rather than knocked left and right.",2021-05-19 05:55:56,1.0,nfnhc1

27vtyrwu,triggerde,"I've played this game for a really long time. After the introduction of the BE system and the hextech crafting system, accessibility for skins increased by a lot, and I view it as a net positive change.   


However, I believe that gemstones have too much of a limited use right now, especially if we don't really want the exclusive 10 gemstones skins available. Crafting ten masterwork chests isn't really amazing either, because, yes I'll be able to get 3 rerolled skins for free, or 10 skin shards to disenchant for orange essence, but that's the almost the same thing as getting chests the regular way. It also takes a really long time for players who don't buy any bundle to gather 10 gemstones.  


I think it'd be amazing if we could select any of the skins currently available in the shop and instead of limiting the 10 gemstones options to exclusive hextech skins only, we could craft one we wanted (with a limit to maybe legendary and below) that'd be awesome. For example, I have 11 gemstones right now. I could craft any skin I want, from stuff like Vancouver Amumu to Elderwood Ornn, or Uncle Ryze.

I think C9 was the best North American representative in recent history in terms of level of play and potential. They showed us glimpses of it vs DK and RNG and even MAD. They just need a bit more time and experience to have some discipline in key moments when they had leads to close these games out.
